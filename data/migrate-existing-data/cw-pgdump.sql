Parking can be challenging in the Echo Canyon lot.

The top access to the rock allows for easy toprope setup, but make sure to bring static line, slings or cordelette, because the wall is lacking bolted anchors. There are a couple of bolted sport routes at Holloway, including Changeling, a 5.12. There are also some great trad leads as well.\r\n\r\nThe rock gets the sun in the afternoon, which allows for great conditions all year round if it isn't snowing. Weekends can occasionally be crowded, especially in summer, but weekdays are a great time to hit up Holloway.\r\n\r\nHolloway is used by Appalachian State University's Recreation Management program to teach climbing site facilitation, and is also utilized by several other local schools for outdoor education, so it is possible to run into a group of students while climbing. They typically stick to the right side of the rock.	t	t	http://www.rockclimbing.com/routes/North_America/United_States/North_Carolina/Western/Holloway_Mount	\N	\N	\N	4873	3	28605	1	-5	\N	0	0	69	\nUpdating elevation for Holloway Mountain with 3359 feet\nUpdating zip code for Holloway Mountain to 28605\nSummarizing daily forecast for Holloway Mountain (826)\nArchiving daily forecast\n/usr/local/bin/degrib /var/local/noaa/degrib/all.ind -DP -pnt 36.147153,-81.760898 -XML 1 -geoData /var/local/noaa/degrib/geodata\nSummarizing hourly for Holloway Mountain (826)\nSphinx 0.9.9-release (r2117)\nCopyright (c) 2001-2009, Andrew Aksyonoff\n\nusing config file '/home/jonstjohn/cw/live/code/config/sphinx.conf'...\nindexing index 'cw_area_index'...\ncollected 321 docs, 0.0 MB\nsorted 0.0 Mhits, 100.0% done\ntotal 321 docs, 33957 bytes\ntotal 0.084 sec, 400961 bytes/sec, 3790.33 docs/sec\ntotal 5 reads, 0.000 sec, 9.1 kb/call avg, 0.0 msec/call avg\ntotal 10 writes, 0.001 sec, 9.6 kb/call avg, 0.1 msec/call avg\nrotating indices: succesfully sent SIGHUP to searchd (pid=10081).\nNearby states: KY,NC,SC,TN,VA,WV\nUpdating clim81 for Holloway Mountain found BLOWING ROCK 1 NW 3.40095200609 miles away\n	2010-12-01 10:00:53+00	2010-12-01 09:16:54+00	0	\N	\N	\N	\N

3	Arizona	AZ	34	-112	6	<p>Topographic Features- Arizona covers 113,909 square miles, with about 350 square miles of water surface. The State has three main topographical areas: (1) a high plateau averaging between 5,000 and 7,000 feet in elevation in the northeast; (2) a mountainous region oriented southeast to northwest with maximum elevations between 9,000 and 12,000 feet above mean sea level; and (3) low mountain ranges and desert valleys in the southwest. From the White Mountains across the Mogollon Rim to the San Francisco Peaks, ponderosa pine forests are found. The Kaibab Plateau north of the Grand Canyon continues this timbered strip into southern Utah. The highest point in the State is Humphreys Peak, north of Flagstaff, with an elevation of 12,633 feet. The desert valleys of southwestern Arizona are an extension of the Sonora Desert of Mexico, with elevations as low as 70 feet above sea level in the lower Colorado River Valley.</p>\r\n<p>The higher elevations of the State average between 25 and 30 inches of liquid precipitation (rain plus the water equivalent from melted snow) annually, while some areas near Yuma, in the desert southwest, average less than three inches per year. Tucson and Phoenix average 12 inches and eight inches, respectively. The plateau country in the northeastern corner of the State receives approximately 10 inches of precipitation annually. Since vegetation in this area consists of sagebrush and native grasses, it is used primarily for grazing. Higher ridges here are covered with junipers and pinion pines.</p>\r\n<p>Nearly the entire State is in the Colorado River drainage basin which empties into the Gulf of California. The Grand Canyon lies within the State, extending southwestward for 217 miles from the junction of the Little Colorado with the main stream. The Grand Canyon varies in width from four to 18 miles, and depths from the rim to the river bed range from 2,700 to 5,700 feet. This is an outstanding example of arid or semiarid land erosion by a major river whose source is in a more rainy area.</p>\r\n<p>Temperature- Cold air masses sometime penetrate the State bringing temperatures well below 0 degrees Fahrenheit (&deg; F) in the high plateau and mountainous regions of central and northern Arizona. The lowest readings can dip to -35&deg; F. Hot temperatures are common throughout the summer months at the lower elevations. Temperatures exceeding 125&deg; F have been observed in the desert area. Great extremes occur between day and night temperatures throughout Arizona. The daily range between minimum and maximum temperatures can be as much as 50 to 60&deg; F during the drier portions of the year. During winter months the lower desert valleys may have daytime temperatures average 70, with night temperatures falling to or slightly below freezing. In the summer, the forests in the central part of the State may have afternoon temperatures of 80&deg; F, while night temperatures drop to 35 to 40&deg; F.</p>\r\n<p>The length of the growing season (freeze-free period) varies tremendously over Arizona. Some of the higher areas in the northern and eastern portions of the State average less than three freeze-free months while lower desert valleys sometimes have several years in succession without a freeze.</p>\r\n<p>Precipitation- Throughout Arizona, precipitation is governed to a great extent by elevation and the season of the year. From November through March, storm systems from the Pacific Ocean cross the State. These storms occur frequently in the higher mountains of the central and northern parts of the State and sometimes bring heavy snows. Snow accumulation may reach depths of 100 inches or more. The melting of this snow during the spring serves to maintain a supply of water in the main rivers of the State. Reservoirs on these streams supply water to the desert areas in the lower Salt and Gila river valleys, which are extensively farmed.</p>\r\n<p>Summer rainfall usually begins early in July and lasts until mid-September. Moisture-bearing winds sweep into Arizona from the southeast, with their source region in the Gulf of Mexico. Another important source of moisture for southern Arizona is the Gulf of California. Summer rains occur in the form of thunderstorms which result largely from excessive heating of the ground and the lifting of moisture-laden air along main mountain ranges. Thus, the heaviest thunderstorms are usually found in mountainous regions of the central and southeastern portions of Arizona. These thunderstorms are often accompanied by strong winds and periods of blowing dust. Hail occurs infrequently.</p>\r\n<p>The average number of days with measurable precipitation per year varies from near 90 in the Flagstaff area to 20 at Yuma. A large portion of Arizona is classified as semiarid and long periods often occur with little or no precipitation. The air is generally dry and clear, with low relative humidity and a high percentage of sunshine. April, May and June are the months with the greatest number of clear days, while July and August, as well as December, January and February have the cloudiest weather and lowest percent of possible sunshine. Humidities, while low when compared to most other states, are higher throughout much of Arizona during July and August, which is the thunderstorm season. A humidity study found values ranging from 55 percent at Flagstaff to around 33 percent at Yuma. Yearly averages of percent of possible sunshine range from 86 percent to 92 percent. Due to high temperatures, the dryness of the air and the high percentage of sunshine, evaporation rates in Arizona are high. Mean annual lake evaporation varies from about 80 inches in the southwestern part of the State to about 50 inches in the northeast. Phoenix and Tucson average over 70 inches of evaporation per year.</p>\r\n<p>Flood conditions occur infrequently, although heavy thunderstorms during July and August at times cause floods that do considerable local damage. Floods on the main rivers are mostly limited to the upper basins above storage dams. Heaviest runoff usually occurs in connection with the arrival of moist tropical air which has its origin in dissipated tropical systems. Heavy rains associated with these systems usually come during August or September and occur, on average, once every 10 years. High winds accompanying heavy thunderstorms during July and August sometimes reach peak gusts of about 100 miles per hour in local areas. Four tornadoes are reported on the average each year.</p>\r\n<p>Climate and the Economy- There are more than one million acres of land devoted to agriculture in the State. Water for the Phoenix area is obtained from storage reservoirs behind Roosevelt Dam on the Salt River, from Horseshoe Dam and Bartlett Dam on the Verde, Carl Pleasant Dam on the Agua Fria and Coolidge Dam on the Gila River. The Yuma area receives its water from the Colorado River. Pumping of water from wells is common in the desert valleys. Extended drought periods sometimes cause curtailment of farming due to lowered water reserves.</p>\r\n<p>Agricultural activities in Arizona include cattle and sheep raising. Some dry-farming is done in northern counties and in the central mountain valleys of the State. This dry-farming is limited primarily to the raising of grains and beans, as well as some fruit. Irrigated crops in the desert valley areas are the most important in the economy of the State. Cotton, alfalfa, grain, citrus fruit, melons, head lettuce and many truck vegetables are grown throughout the year. Fruits and vegetables find ready markets throughout the country.</p>\r\n<p>Numerous national monuments furnish recreational facilities throughout Arizona. The South Rim of the Grand Canyon is a very popular attraction throughout the entire year. The roads are kept open to the South Rim throughout the winter months. Winter sports are popular in some of the mountainous regions of the State. Forests throughout central Arizona provide hunting of elk, deer, wild turkey, while desert areas are abundant in smaller game which includes: javelina, desert mule deer, quail and dove. Fishing is practiced throughout the year in the mountain streams and in numerous reservoirs, as well as, in the Colorado River.</p>\r\n<p>The climate has attracted large industrial operations. Manufacturers have established proving grounds in Arizona, in order to take advantage of the diversity of climate within relatively short distances.</p>\r\n<p>Mild winter temperatures and the absence of snowfall in the desert areas of southern Arizona attract many winter tourists and full-time residents to the State. Both have proven to be of real economic significance.</p>	31.33333	-114.83333	37.00000	-109.05000	0.815

5	California	CA	36.8	-120	5	<p>Topographic Features- California extends along the shore of the Pacific Ocean between 32.5 and 42&deg; North latitude. Its more than 1,340 miles of coastline constitutes nearly three-fourths of the Pacific coastline of the conterminous United States. Bounded on the north by Oregon, on the east by Nevada and Arizona, and on the south by Mexico, the total land area amounts to 158,693 square miles. With its major axis oriented in a northwest-southeast direction, the State is 800 miles in length. Its greatest east-west dimension is about 360 miles though its average width is 250 miles. However, it spreads over more than 10 degrees of longitude, a distance of 550 miles.</p>\r\n<p>The Coast Range parallels the coastline from the Oregon border to just north of the Los Angeles Basin. It is generally no more than 50 miles from the coast to the crest of the range. The mountains rise abruptly from the ocean or from the narrow coastal plain to elevations of several thousand feet. Some peaks in the north are more than 8,000 feet above sea level.</p>\r\n<p>The principal break in the Coast Range is at San Francisco Bay where an opening permits an abundant flow of marine air into the interior of the State under certain circulation patterns.</p>\r\n<p>In the northern part of the State, the Coast Range merges with the Cascade Range, farther inland, to create an extensive area of rugged terrain more than 200 miles in width. The streams in the area work their way westward through deep canyons to the Pacific Ocean.</p>\r\n<p>The Cascades then extend southeastward until they merge into the Sierra Nevada. In the north, the Cascades range generally from 5,000 to 10,000 feet in height, with Mt. Shasta rising to 14,162 feet. Farther south, the Sierra Nevada rise to over 10,000 feet in elevation. The Sierra Nevada, like the Coast Range, parallel the coast, but the crest over most of its length is about 150 miles inland. Thus, between the two ranges there is a broad, flat valley averaging 45 miles or more in width. At approximately 35&deg; North latitude, the Sierra Nevada meet the Tehachapi Mountains. These then bend southwestward to join the Coast Range, closing off the southern end of the Central Valley.</p>\r\n<p>From the point where the Tehachapi and the Coast Range join, a series of ranges extend southeastward to the southern border of the State. West of these ranges are basins that have a predominantly maritime climate, while to the east a continental desert regime prevails.</p>\r\n<p>Both the extreme northeastern portion of California and the desert area of southern California east of the mountains lie within the Great Basin. The Great Basin extends from Utah to the Sierra Nevada and has no surface drainage to the ocean. It is an area of climatological extremes. In northeastern California, for example, Boca is one of the coldest reporting points in the State. Included in the deserts of the south, are Death Valley and the Mojave Desert. These are the hottest and driest parts of the State.</p>\r\n<p>Streams in the southern part of California are small and intermittent. Draining the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada, however, is a series of streams of varying size. In the north, the Pit and Sacramento rivers combine to flow the length of the Sacramento Valley, through the Delta area, into San Francisco Bay. At intervals along the way, other streams join the Sacramento. Some of these are the: Feather, Yuba, Bear and American, all streams of considerable size, along with lesser creeks that drain small watersheds.</p>\r\n<p>The San Joaquin Valley lies south of the Delta. Streams coming from the mountains into the northern two-thirds of the San Joaquin Valley empty into the San Joaquin River and drain northward to join the Sacramento River just before emptying into San Francisco Bay. In the southern one-third of the Valley, streams have no natural drainage to the ocean and much of the water is diverted away, however, occasionally water still empties into now usually dry Tulare Lake and Buena Vista Lake Bed.</p>\r\n<p>Most of the major streams are fed by melting snow from the high slopes of the Sierra Nevada. Streamflow continues well into or throughout the arid summer months. Nearly all of the streams have been dammed to hold the water supply in reservoirs for irrigation, industrial and domestic uses throughout the dry part of the year, and to provide flood control during the winter and spring. As a result, less and less water from these streams flows directly to the ocean. Most of it is being used at least once before being drained to the ocean or put into storage.</p>\r\n<p>At the north end of the State, an extensive area is drained by the: Klamath, Salmon, Trinity, Eel and Van Duzen rivers.</p>\r\n<p>The largest streams on the central coast are the Russian River, which empties into the ocean about 50 miles north of San Francisco, and the Salinas River, which discharges into Monterey Bay. Other streams along the coast are short and small.</p>\r\n<p>The Central Valley lies between the Coast Range and the Sierra Nevada. At the point where the rivers empty through Carquinez Strait into San Francisco Bay, the valley floor is only about 10 feet above sea level. Indeed, some reclaimed farmland within the delta system lies at or below sea level. At the north end of the Central Valley, Red Bluff is approximately 300 feet in elevation, while Bakersfield, near the south end, is around 400 feet. In length the valley extends nearly 500 miles, while the width of the floor is about 45 miles; when the gently sloping foothill area is included it extends to about 120 miles.</p>\r\n<p>Within the State are found a variety of climates and extremes. Temperatures have been recorded from -45 degrees Fahrenheit (&deg; F) to 134. Annual precipitation has exceeded 150 inches at one measuring site, while other points have gone for more than a year with no measurable rain. This variation in climate results from a number of causes.</p>\r\n<p>The topography of the State is varied and includes Death Valley, the lowest point in the western hemisphere, with an elevation of 282 feet below sea level and less than 85 miles away, Mt. Whitney, the highest peak in the conterminous states at 14,494 feet above sea level. These wide ranges of altitude are responsible in part for the variety of climates and vegetation found in the State. Another significant factor is the continuous interaction of maritime air masses with those of continental origin. The combination of these influences results in pronounced climatic changes within short distances.</p>\r\n<p>Over the northern three-fourths of the State, there are two primary mountain chains paralleling the coast, while in the southern one-fourth there is only one. Isotherms run mostly north-south, parallel to the contours of the mountains. Along the western side of the Coast Range, the climate is dominated by the Pacific Ocean. Warm winters, cool summers, small daily and seasonal temperature ranges and high relative humidities are characteristic of this area. With increasing distance from the ocean, the maritime influence decreases. Areas that are well protected from the ocean experience a more continental type of climate with warmer summers, colder winters, greater daily and seasonal temperature ranges and generally lower relative humidities. Many parts of the State lie within a transitional zone where conditions range between these two climatic extremes. The mixture depends upon local topography and its influence on circulation patterns.</p>\r\n<p>Summer is dry over most of the State. With the northward migration of the semi-permanent Pacific high, most storm tracks are deflected far to the north. California seldom receives precipitation from Pacific storms during this time of year. Occasionally, however, moist air drifts northward during the warm months from the Gulf of Mexico or the Gulf of California. At such times, scattered, locally heavy showers occur, mostly over the desert and mountain portions of the State.</p>\r\n<p>The Pacific high decreases in intensity in winter and moves further south, permitting storms to move into and across the State, producing widespread rain at low elevations and snow at high elevations. Occasionally the broad-scale circulation pattern permits a series of storms to move into California from the southwest. This type of storm pattern is responsible for occasional heavy rains that may cause serious flooding.</p>\r\n<p>The easternmost mountain chains form a barrier that protects much of California from the extremely cold air of the Great Basin in winter. There are occasions when cold air from an extensive high pressure area spreads westward and southward over California. In these cases, the warming by compression as the air flows down the slopes of the mountains into the valleys results in considerable moderation of temperatures. The ranges of mountains to the west offer some protection to the interior from the strong flow of air off the Pacific Ocean. As a result, precipitation is heavy on the coastal or western side of both the Coast Range and the Sierra Nevada and lighter on the eastern slopes. Precipitation is also slightly reduced at the highest elevations of the Sierra Nevada because the range extends above the level of maximum transport of the moisture-laden winds from the Pacific.</p>\r\n<p>There is a trend toward temperature uniformity from day to day and from season to season on the ocean side of the Coast Range and in coastal valleys. East of the Sierra Nevada, temperature patterns are continental in character with wide excursions from high readings to low. Between the two mountain chains and over much of the desert area, the temperature regime is intermediate between maritime and continental air masses. Hot summers are the rule while winters are moderate to cold.</p>\r\n<p>In the basins and valleys adjoining the coast, climate is subject to wide variations within short distances as a result of the influence of topography on the circulation of marine air. The Los Angeles Basin and the San Francisco Bay area offer many varieties of climate within a few miles. In the Bay area, for example, the average maximum temperature in July is about 65&deg; F at Half Moon Bay on the coast, 87 at Walnut Creek 25 miles inland, and 93 at Tracy, another 25 miles inland. Santa Monica Pier, in the Los Angeles area, enjoys a normal July maximum of around 69&deg; F, while the average increases to 95&deg; F at Canoga Park in the San Fernando Valley just 15 miles to the north.</p>\r\n<p>The steady flow of air from the northwest during the summer helps to drive the California Current southward almost parallel to the California coastline. However, since the mean drift is slightly offshore, there is a band of upwelling immediately off the coast as water from deeper layers is drawn into the surface circulation. The water from below the surface is colder than the semi-permanent band of cold water just offshore, which ranges from 25 to 50 miles in width.</p>\r\n<p>The temperature of water reaching the surface from deeper levels varies from about 49 in winter to 55&deg; F in late summer along the northern California coast, and from 57 to 65 on the southern California coast. At a distance of 200 to 300 miles offshore, surface water temperatures range from 51 to 65&deg; F in the north and from 60 to 67 in the south. Thus, the water near the coastline is as much as 10&deg; F colder during the summer than is the water farther west.</p>\r\n<p>Comparatively warm, moist Pacific air masses drifting over this band of cold water form a fog bank which is often carried inland by the prevailing northwest winds. In general, heat is added to the air as it moves inland during the summer months, and the fog quickly lifts to form a deck of low clouds that extend inland only a short distance before evaporating completely. Characteristically, this deck of clouds extends inland further during the night and then recedes to the vicinity of the coast during the day. This layer of maritime air is usually from 1,500 to 2,000 feet deep, while above this layer the air is relatively warm, dry and cloudless.</p>\r\n<p>Temperature- On the coast, the small range in temperature from day to night and from winter to summer produces an unusually equable regime. With increasing distance from the coast, depending to some extent upon the amount of marine influence experienced, temperature ranges become wider. Higher elevations in the mountains also experience large temperature variation.</p>\r\n<p>The lowest temperature recorded in the State was at Boca, 5,532 feet in Nevada County, when a reading of -45&deg; F was observed on January 20, 1937. At Boca, where temperatures of 21&deg; F or colder have been recorded in every month of the year, the long-term average minimum for January is 11. Greenland Ranch, on the other hand, at an elevation of 168 feet below sea level, has reported a maximum temperature of 134&deg; F. This is the highest temperature observed anywhere in the United States, and occurred on July 10, 1913. This is an area where temperatures are persistently high throughout the summer. In the summer of 1917, there were 43 consecutive days with maximum readings of 120&deg; F or higher at Greenland Ranch.</p>\r\n<p>The average length of the growing season, as limited by occurrences of 32&deg; F temperatures, ranges from 365 days on the south coast to less than 50 days at high elevations of the Sierras. Most coastal valleys and the Central Valley have a freeze-free season of 225 to 300 days. The agricultural area within the southeastern desert basin experiences a growing season ranging from 225 to 325 days long. The season is limited to 100 to 125 days in the northeastern interior.</p>\r\n<p>Precipitation- Annual precipitation totals in excess of 50 inches per year are characteristic of the west slope of the Sierra Nevada north of Stockton, the west slope of the Coast Range from Monterey County northward and parts of the Cascades. Exceptions to this are totals that decrease to about 20 inches in the vicinity of Monterey Bay and parts of the San Francisco Bay area. In the lee of the Coast Range, average yearly amounts drop off to 15 inches in parts of the Sacramento Valley and to less than eight inches over most of the San Joaquin Valley. The northeast interior portion of the State receives from 15 to 18 inches of precipitation a year.</p>\r\n<p>Thunderstorms may occur in California at any time of the year. Near the coast and over the Central Valley there appears to be no definite season. The storms are usually light and infrequent. Over the interior mountain areas storms are more intense, and they may become unusually severe on occasion in the Sierra Nevada. In these mountain areas, thunderstorms occur 50 to 60 days per year.</p>\r\n<p>Snow has been reported in nearly every part of California, but it is very infrequent west of the Sierra Nevada except at high elevations of the Coast Range and the Cascades. In the Sierra Nevada, moderate amounts of snow are reported nearly every winter at elevations as low as 2,000 feet. Amounts and intensities increase with elevation to around 7,000 or 8,000 feet. Above 4,000 feet elevation snow remains on the ground for appreciable lengths of time each winter. Occasionally, highways are closed due to blowing and drifting snow. East of the Sierra Nevada at elevations of 4,000 feet and higher, most winter precipitation is in the form of snow, but amounts are usually quite light.</p>\r\n<p>California lies within the zone of prevailing westerlies and on the east side of the semi-permanent high pressure area of the northeast Pacific Ocean. The basic flow is from the west or northwest during most of the year. Mountain chains within the State, however, are responsible for deflecting these winds and, except for the immediate coast, wind direction is likely to be more a product of local terrain than it is of prevailing circulation.</p>\r\n<p>During the winter, wind direction and speed are modified by migratory pressure centers. With a strong high pressure area over the Great Basin and an intense low pressure area approaching from the west, strong and sometimes damaging winds occur, usually from an easterly or southeasterly direction, especially along the coast and in the coastal mountains. As the storms move inland, the winds veer to southerly and southwesterly directions, and high wind speeds may occur anywhere within the State with the greatest velocities at high elevations.</p>\r\n<p>Under a slightly different configuration of these pressure systems, winds tend to flow out of the Great Basin into the Central Valley, the Southeastern Desert Basin, and the South Coast. Such wind situations are known in southern California as 'Santa Ana' winds. The air is typically very dry. The winds are strong and gusty, sometimes exceed 100 mph, particularly near the mouth of canyons oriented along the direction of airflow. It is a situation that leads to serious fire suppression problems and often results in the temporary closing of sections of highways.</p>\r\n<p>A similar circulation pattern creates the 'northers' of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys. As a result of compressional heating of air flowing out of the Great Basin, this situation results in pronounced summer heat waves. In winter, the result is usually a rather mild temperature accompanied by a dry, persistent wind.</p>\r\n<p>The typical northwest wind of summer is reinforced by the dynamics of the thermal low pressure area located over the Central Valley and the Southeastern Desert area. In the San Francisco Bay area there is a marked diurnal pattern in the strength of the wind even though an onshore circulation tends to continue throughout the 24-hour period.</p>\r\n<p>The Los Angeles Basin is almost completely enclosed by mountains on the north and east. The Pacific Ocean lies to the west. A temperature inversion tends to prevent vertical mixing of the air through more than a shallow layer. The geographical configuration and the southerly location of the Basin permit a fairly regular daily reversal of wind directionâoffshore at night and onshore during the day. Pollution products tend to accumulate and remain within this circulation pattern.</p>\r\n<p>Another local characteristic of the northwest wind along the shore is the creation of a jet effect in the vicinity of some of the more prominent headlands. The most outstanding of these currents of air is found off of and to the south of Point Arguello. Here a strong jet of air is projected southward past San Miguel and San Nicholas Islands, driving a huge eddy as much as 200 miles in diameter. The air swings eastward near San Diego then northward and westward along the coast to rejoin the southward flowing air at the west end of the Santa Barbara Channel. Similar but smaller eddies form in the vicinity of the Golden Gate, just south of Point Reyes and south of Monterey Bay around Point Sur. Wind speeds in the immediate vicinity of these major headlands can be two or three times as great as the wind flow at nearby points.</p>\r\n<p>During periods of moderate to strong upper level, westerly flow over central parts of the State, particularly during the winter and spring, a 'Sierra Wave' is created near Bishop.</p>\r\n<p>On annual average, five tornadoes are reported in the State. They are generally not severe, in many cases amounting to little more than damage to trees or light buildings. In addition, pilots occasionally report funnel clouds aloft.</p>\r\n<p>With the broad expanse of water to the west of California, the fetch of wind over hundreds of miles permits the buildup of seas and surf during much of the year. Seas of five feet or higher are observed most frequently off the California coast during spring with a 30 to 40 percent occurrence. Seas of eight feet or more occur 10 to 20 percent of the time, and seas of 12 feet or more are observed between five and 10 percent of the time during the spring. Such seas result in good surfing conditions at many beaches.</p>\r\n<p>In general, relative humidities are moderate to high along the coast throughout the year. Inland hunidities are high during the winter and low during the summer. With increasing distance from the ocean, relative humidity tends to decrease. Where mountain barriers prevent the flow of marine air inland, humidities rapidly decrease. Openings in these barriers permit a significant influx of cool, moist air and as it mixes with the drier inland air, a more gradual decrease of moisture results. This pattern is characteristic of most coastal valleys. Meanwhile, the Stateâs deserts experience very low humidities with the high temperatures of summer. Winter humidity is usually moderate to low and only occasionally do moist air and cool temperatures combine to produce high relative humidity readings.</p>\r\n<p>The Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys are areas of variable relative humidity. During the warm season, humidities are characteristically low and occasionally, under the influence of the 'norther', readings may drop to below 10 percent. In the Delta, at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, a strong inflow of marine air during the summer creates a transition zone between the high humidities of the coast and the low readings of the interior. Winter values are usually moderate to high. A shallow layer of ground fog, known locally as 'tule fog', frequently forms at night and can persist for as long as two or three weeks.</p>\r\n<p>Many California thunderstorms produce little to no precipitation. Range and forest fires often result from the lightning strikes. However, each year, some flash flooding is reported as a result of thunderstorms dropping heavy rain especially on steep slopes. Hail, up to one-half inch in diameter is sometimes reported, but serious damage is infrequent.</p>\r\n<p>In southern California most flooding is the result of heavy precipitation over a period of days. The short streams and steep watersheds emptying onto lowlands that may be heavily populated produce large volumes of water within short periods and damage is often severe. The problem is sometimes compounded by the denuding of large areas of the watershed by fire during the previous season.</p>\r\n<p>The west slopes of the coastal ranges in the central and northern parts of the State also experience flooding as a result of heavy precipitation over a period of days. These streams are usually longer than those of southern California and require a longer time to build up a flood potential. The Eel and Klamath rivers, as well as others in the northwestern part of California, are larger streams. The Klamath drains a basin of more than 12,000 square miles. In these streams, a flood buildup may extend over a period of a week or longer.</p>\r\n<p>The streams of the Sierra Nevada and Cascades overflow either as a result of rainfall or snowmelt, or from a combination of these. Dams and reservoirs on these streams help decrease the flood potential. Most of the streams are still capable, however, of causing occasional major damage along their downstream reaches.</p>\r\n<p>Climate and the Economy- There are extended periods every summer with little or no precipitation. This is the normal and expected condition. A precipitation deficiency becomes significant in the State when the normal winter water supply fails to materialize. Winter range is important in the livestock industry. An abnormally dry winter can be disastrous to cattle raising.</p>\r\n<p>Most of Californiaâs water supply is used for agriculture. A shortage of irrigation water stored at the beginning of the season is serious, since normal summer precipitation does not provide a sufficient amount of agricultureâs requirements. California has millions of acres of farm land under irrigation.</p>\r\n<p>Most of the water supply for crops comes from the mountains of the State. Falling as rain or snow, it is held in reservoirs and as snow pack. A smaller part of the Stateâs water requirement is met by water from the Rockies via the Colorado River. This water is used in the southeastern Desert and the south coastal area. Within the State, approximately three-quarters of the stream flow is generated in the area north of the latitude of Sacramento, while more than four-fifths of the water requirements lie south of this line. Thus, water distribution is a major concern in the State.</p>\r\n<p>The long growing season characteristic of most of the valley areas where agriculture is concentrated is an important factor in the production picture. Some parts of the State are able to produce winter truck crops. The long dry spell of the summer facilitates the planting, cultivation, and harvest of many crops, and isolated late spring, summer or early fall rains can possibly cause more damage than good. Splitting of ripening fruit sometimes results from unseasonable showers at an inappropriate time. Drying winds occasionally cause damage to developing crops. In general, however, the distribution of temperature and precipitation is highly favorable for most agricultural enterprises.</p>	32.50000	-124.40000	42.00000	-114.13333	0.803
6	Colorado	CO	39.2	-105.5	6	<p>Topographic Features- Colorado lies astride the highest mountains of the Continental Divide. Nearly rectangular, its north and south boundaries are the 41&deg; and 37&deg; North latitude parallels, respectively. The east and west boundaries are the 102&deg; and 109&deg; West meridians. It is eighth in size among the 50 states, with an area of over 104,000 square miles. Although known for its mountains, nearly 40 percent of its area is taken up by the eastern high plains. Of particular importance to the climate are Colorado's interior continental location in the middle latitudes, the high elevation of the entire region, and the mountains and ranges extending north and south approximately through the middle of the State. With an average altitude of about 6,800 feet above sea level, Colorado is the highest contiguous State in the Union. Roughly three-quarters of the 48 contiguous statesâ land above 10,000 feet altitude lies within its borders. The State has 59 mountains in excess of 14,000 feet and about 830 mountains between 11,000 and 14,000 feet in elevation. Gradually emerging from the plains of Kansas and Nebraska, the high plains of Colorado gently slope upward for a distance of some 200 miles from the eastern border to the base of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The eastern portion of the State is generally level to rolling prairie broken by occasional hills and bluffs. Although subtle when compared to the high mountains of the Rockies, there are also important topographic features across eastern Colorado. Two major river valleys dissect eastern Colorado, the South Platte River in northeastern Colorado and the Arkansas River in the southeast. Higher ground extends eastward from the Rockies between the river valleys. High ground also extends eastward along the New Mexico border to the south and along the Wyoming and Nebraska borders to the north. These features have an impact on temperatures, wind patterns and storm tracks in all seasons. Elevations along the eastern border of Colorado range from 3,350 feet at the lowest point in the State where the Arkansas River crosses into Kansas to near 4,000 feet. Elevations increase towards the west to between 5,000 and 6,500 feet where the plains meet the Front Range of the Rocky Mountain chain. Here elevations rise abruptly to 7,000 to 9,000 feet. Backing the foothills are the mountain ranges above 9,000 feet with the higher peaks over 14,000 feet. The most dramatic feature is Pike's Peak near Colorado Springs where elevations rise abruptly from 4,662 feet at Pueblo, in the Arkansas valley, to 14,110 feet at the mountain summit. During the summer months, this topographic feature becomes a "thunderstorm machine" as thunderstorms develop almost any day that humidity is sufficiently high. West of these "front ranges" are additional ranges, generally extending north/south, but with many spurs and extensions in other directions. These ranges enclose numerous high mountain parks and valleys. Farther westward, the mountains give way to rugged plateau country in the form of high mesas (some more than 10,000 feet in elevation) which extends to the western border of the State. This land is often cut by rugged canyons, the work of the many steams fed by accumulations of winter snow.</p>\r\n<p>Colorado is a headwater state. All rivers in Colorado rise within its borders and flow outward, with the exception of the Green River, which flows diagonally across the extreme northwestern corner of the State. Four of the Nation's major rivers have their source in Colorado, the: Colorado, Rio Grande, Arkansas and Platte.</p>\r\n<p>Most of Colorado has a climate commonly thought of as a mountain climate. Generally, the Colorado climate is cool and comfortable. The humidity is low and temperatures are moderated by the altitude. The thin atmosphere allows for a greater penetration of solar radiation and results in pleasant temperatures even during the winter months. This accounts for the general lack of heavy clothing being worn by some skiers.</p>\r\n<p>The mountains are the most significant moderators of Coloradoâs climate. They have an effect on all aspects of weather passing through the State. Huge variations in weather can be felt in relatively short distances. For example, the difference in annual mean temperature between Pikes Peak and Las Animas is equal to that of Iceland and Florida. This is a large range when you take into account the 100 miles between Pikes Peak and Las Animas versus the several thousand miles between Florida and Iceland. Similar effects on precipitation can be observed. The general patterns of mountainous climate can be further modified by the orientation of the mountain slopes with the prevailing winds in creating local air movements.</p>\r\n<p>As a result of the Stateâs distance from major sources of moisture, precipitation is usually light in the lower elevations. Prevailing air currents reach Colorado from westerly directions. Storms that have their origin in the Pacific Ocean lose much of their moisture as they pass over the mountains. The Eastern slopes of the Stateâs mountains receive very little rain, especially in the heart of winter.</p>\r\n<p>Storms moving from the north usually carry little moisture. The frequency of such storms increases during the fall and winter, and then decreases rapidly in the spring. The accompanying outbreaks of polar air are responsible for the sudden drops in temperature often experienced in the plains sections of the State. Occasionally these outbreaks are attended by strong northerly winds which come in contact with moist air from the south; the interaction of these air masses can cause a heavy fall of snow and the most severe of all weather conditions of the high plains, the blizzard. This cold air is frequently too shallow to cross the mountains to the western portion of the State so while the plains are in the grip of a very severe storm, the weather in the mountains and western valleys may be mild.</p>\r\n<p>Occasionally, when the plains are covered with a shallow layer of cold air strong, westerly winds aloft work their way to the surface. Warmed by rapid descent from higher levels, these winds bring large and sudden temperature rises. This phenomenon is the "Chinook" of the high plains. Temperature rises of 25 to 35 degrees Fahrenheit (&deg; F) within a short time are not uncommon. Chinook winds greatly moderate average winter temperatures in areas near enough to the mountains to experience them frequently. Due to these wind patterns, some locations in the eastern foothills are warmer than adjacent areas on the eastern plains on many days during the winter.</p>\r\n<p>Warm, moist air from the south moves into Colorado infrequently, but most often in the spring, summer and early autumn. As this air is carried northward and westward to higher elevations, the heaviest and most general rainfalls (and sometimes wet snows) occur over the eastern portions of the State from April through early September. For southern and western Colorado, the intrusions of moist air are most common from mid-July into September associated with wind patterns sometimes called the âSouthwest Monsoonâ. Frequent showers and thunderstorms continue through the summer. At times during the summer, winds shift to the southwest and bring hot, dry air from the desert Southwest over the State. Such hot spells are usually of short duration.</p>\r\n<p>Temperature- Coloradoâs topography plays such a large role in dictating the Stateâs temperatures. It is not uncommon for temperatures to differ by 10 to 15&deg; F within a 50 mile radius. Elevation is the main reason for this observed difference. The effect of elevation on temperature is what makes it difficult to summarize Colorado climate. In the winter, much of the State below 5,000 feet has maximum temperatures of 40 to 48&deg; F. Above 5,000 feet, a cooling with altitude is noticed. The average maximum mean temperatures for the higher elevations of Colorado range from 28 to 40&deg; F throughout the winter. The mean maximum temperature for January at stations at 5,000 feet elevation is about 40&deg; F, while stations at elevations of 7,000 feet have temperatures near 32&deg; F, and stations at elevations of 8,000 feet have temperatures around 25. Coloradoâs topography has the effect of making temperatures consistent day-to-day. It requires a relatively deep wedge of cold air to make the temperatures of the mountains to drop significantly below normal. However, the normal low temperatures for many of the stations are very cold with mean winter lows in the 14 to 17&deg; F range. Some of the higher elevations even have mean winter lows that are subzero. Occasionally, an unusually cold air mass remains over the State. Several stations have recorded temperatures as low as -30&deg; F, while other stations have reported extreme lows as being in the -20 range. On February 1, 1985, Maybell, elevation 5,920 feet, posted Coloradoâs lowest temperature on record at -61&deg; F.</p>\r\n<p>Temperatures warm rapidly from March to May but still maintain a chilly feel. Many of the observing stations record mean temperatures in March and April not exceeding 40&deg; F. This is significant because much of the State experiences maximum temperatures in March and April between 45 and 61&deg; F. This means that for most of March and April nighttime temperatures are at freezing or below. This is one factor that makes snow skiing such a successful industry in Colorado.</p>\r\n<p>The summer months have temperature trends that are similar to that of the winter. The higher you are the cooler you will be. Many of the stations have peak summer mean maximum temperatures from 80 in the mountains to 90&deg; F in the eastern high plains. The position of Colorado with in the North American continent makes for a very comfortable summer. It is rare to see a humid air mass encompass the entire State. So the heat of summer is not quite as oppressive as that felt in the eastern United States. Colorado summers are not free from excessive heat. Several stations report extreme high temperatures well above 100&deg; F. The Stateâs highest recorded temperature was 118&deg; F at Bennett, elevation 5,484 on July 11, 1888.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Precipitation- An important feature of the precipitation in the plains is the seasonal cycle. A very large proportion (70 to 80 percent of the annual total) falls during the growing season from April through September. Cool season precipitation can be important for soil moisture recharge, but mid-winter precipitation is light and infrequent. More often, winter brings dry air and strong winds contributing to the aridity of the area. From early March through early June, periodic widespread storms bring soaking beneficial moisture that helps crops and grasslands. Summer precipitation over the plains comes largely from thunderstorm activity and is sometimes extremely heavy. Localized rains in excess of four inches sometimes fall in just a few hours contributing to local flooding. In late May 1935, nearly two feet of rain fell along the Republican River in eastern Colorado causing one of the worst floods in the Stateâs history. June flash floods in 1965 were also devastating. The weather station at Holly, in southeastern Colorado, measured 18.82" of rainfall in that extraordinarily wet month. It is more common, however, to be too dry. Annual average precipitation ranges from less than 12 inches in the Arkansas Valley between Pueblo and Las Animas to almost 18 inches in extreme northeastern and southeastern corners of the State. Many years are drier than average, and some years receive less than half the long-term average. The region seems almost always in or on the verge of drought. Multi-year drought is common to the area such as the decade-long drought of the 1930s, the severe drought of the mid 1950s and 1970s and the recent intense widespread drought of the early 2000s.</p>\r\n<p>Precipitation west of the Continental Divide is more evenly distributed throughout the year than in the eastern plains. For most of western Colorado, the greatest monthly precipitation occurs in the winter months, while June is the driest month. Near the Utah border, late summer and early autumn can be the wettest time of year. While precipitation only averages from eight to 14 inches in these western valleys, localized flood-producing storms are still possible. Occasionally, moisture from a decayed Pacific hurricane has fueled widespread heavy rains. Extensive flooding occurred in October 1970 following one of these storm systems.</p>\r\n<p>Precipitation patterns are largely controlled by mountain ranges and elevation. Precipitation increases with elevation both winter and summer but the elevation effect is greatest in mid-winter when winds at mountain top level are typically strongest. High peaks and mountain ranges generally receive the majority of their precipitation during the winter months. Snow accumulates without melting in shaded or level areas at elevations above about 8,000 feet. When it melts in the spring, this snow is the primary source of water for much of the population of the State and provides water for extensive irrigation. Considerable effort is made every year to measure the accumulating snow pack so that water providers and resource managers can plan ahead for the coming summer. Most of the mountain snow melts during May and June causing rivers to reach their yearly peak. In summer, mountain peaks and ranges are effective thunderstorm generators whenever the air mass is sufficiently moist. In some years, local thunderstorms form nearly every afternoon in and near the mountains. Mid-July through much of August are particularly prone to mountain thunderstorms while June is often a much drier month in the high country. Snow and soft hail are possible from mountain storms even in July and August. Hikers and participants in other outdoor activities in the mountains during the summer months must be careful to avoid exposed ridges during stormy periods, as lightning poses a very serious threat throughout the summer. Lightning also triggers forest fires.</p>\r\n<p>Thunderstorms are quite prevalent on the eastern plains and along the eastern slopes of the mountains during the spring and summer. These often become quite severe, and the frequency of hail damage to crops in northeastern Colorado is quite high. With an average frequency of six or more hail days per year, some counties of eastern Colorado are among the most hail prone areas in the entire country. Tornadoes, once thought to be only a small threat to the residents of eastern Colorado, have been found to be quite common with the improvement in severe storm detection in recent decades. Tornadoes are relatively rare in the mountains and western valleys but do occur. Annually, 25 tornadoes are reported across the State, on average. Most of these tornadoes are small and short lived, usually classified in intensity as F0 or F1. However, occasional strong tornadoes have been reported. The number of tornado fatalities remains very low for Colorado, but much of this is due to the low population density of some of the most tornado-prone areas of eastern Colorado. Lightning has emerged as one of the greatest weather hazards in Colorado. Each year there are typically several fatalities and injuries. Unlike tornadoes that are most common in selected areas of the State, lightning can and does occur everywhere. Lightning strike statistics indicate that the most lightning prone areas of Colorado are the high ground above tree line between Denver and Colorado Springs and the Raton Plateau south and southeast of Trinidad near the New Mexico border. Fall, winter and spring blizzards on the eastern high plains are another weather hazard deserving attention. While Colorado blizzards are less frequent and drop less snow than in areas further east and north, they can still be devastating. In 1997, several fatalities were directly attributable to an October blizzard which caught many travelers unprepared. Heavy snows in the high mountains are much more common. Each year several lives are lost due to avalanches. Avalanches pose a serious problem to residents, road maintenance crews and back country travelers. Considerable effort is made each year to predict and manage avalanches. A spring flood potential results from the melting of the snow pack at the higher elevations. In a year of near-normal snow accumulations in the mountains and normal spring temperatures, river stages become high, but there is no general flooding. In years when snow cover is heavy, or when there is widespread lower elevation snow accumulation and a sudden warming in the spring, there may be extensive flooding. The greatest threat of flooding in Colorado is not snowmelt, however. It is flash flooding from localized intense thunderstorms. The most flash-flood prone regions of Colorado are found along the base of the lower foothills east of the mountains. Several extreme floods such as the infamous Big Thompson Canyon flood of July 31, 1976 have occurred in this vulnerable area. Flash floods occur on the western slopes as well, but with somewhat lower frequency and intensity due to a reduced supply of low level moisture to fuel such storms.</p>\r\n<p>Climate and the Economy- For the most part, Colorado has a semi-arid climate. This means that water is the limiting factor for agriculture. The areas in Colorado that are farmed get very little water in the form of direct rainfall. Instead, they receive most of there water from irrigation systems that have tapped reservoirs formed from snowmelt. This snowmelt is sufficient for farmers to develop a variety of crops. Water accessibility coupled with the different climates of Colorado permit a very diverse agriculture. Some areas produce grains while areas around the mountains produce fruits.</p>\r\n<p>Tourism is one of the largest industries in Colorado. The comfortable weather and the recreational activities offered are all thanks to the Rocky Mountains. The rugged landscapes lend themselves to hikers and campers. The rivers and cold water streams are excellent places to fish and kayak. The scenery can be breath-taking.</p>\r\n<p>One industry that owes everything to weather is the skiing industry. The amount of snowfall and the length of the freezing season, make Colorado one of the most visited places among skiers. Many resorts are open from November until late April.</p>	37.00000	-109.00000	41.00000	-102.00000	1.320
7	Connecticut	CT	41.7	-72.6	8	<p>Topographic Features- Connecticut occupies the southwestern portion of New England. The State extends for 90 miles in an east-west direction and 75 miles from north to south. With a total area of 5,009 square miles, Connecticut is the Nation's third smallest state.</p>\r\n<p>The topography of Connecticut is primarily hilly. The highest terrain is found in the northwest portion of the State, with elevations of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. The southwestern quarter and most of the eastern half have elevations of 300 to 1,000 feet. The State is bisected by the Connecticut River which rises to the north. Smaller river basins in the State with their headwaters in the southern half of Massachusetts include the Housatonic in the west and the Shetucket and Quinebaug which eventually form the Thames in the east. The narrow river valleys and steep hillsides in much of the western highlands make for destructive flash flooding during periods of unusually heavy or intense rainfall.</p>\r\n<p>The entire southern border of Connecticut is formed by the Long Island Sound. The coastline of approximately 100 miles in length is indented by small coves and the mouths of numerous rivers and streams.</p>\r\n<p>The chief characteristics of Connecticut's climate are: equitable distribution of precipitation among the four seasons; large ranges in temperature, both daily and annual; great differences in the same season or month of different years; and considerable diversity of weather over short periods of time.</p>\r\n<p>Connecticut lies in the "prevailing westerlies", the belt of generally eastward moving air encircling the globe in the mid-latitudes. Embedded in this circulation are extensive masses of air originating in higher or lower latitudes and interacting to produce low pressure systems. Relative to most other sections of the country, a large number of such storms pass over or near to Connecticut.</p>\r\n<p>The majority of air masses affecting the State belong to three types: cold, dry air originating in the North American sub-arctic; warm, moist air streaming northward from the Gulf of Mexico and subtropical waters (Gulf Stream) to the east; as well as cool, damp air moving in from the North Atlantic. Because the atmospheric flow is usually from continental areas, Connecticut is influenced more by the first two types than it is by the third. In other words, the adjacent ocean constitutes an important modifying factor, especially along the immediate coast, but does not dominate the State's climate.</p>\r\n<p>The procession of contrasting air masses and the relatively frequent passage of storm circulations bring about a roughly twice-weekly alternation from mainly fair to cloudy or stormy conditions. These fluctuations are often attended by abrupt changes in sunshine, temperature, moisture, wind direction and speed. There is usually no regular or persistent rhythm to this sequence, and it can be interrupted by intervals during which the weather patterns continue stable for several days or even several weeks on certain occasions.</p>\r\n<p>Connecticut's weather, however, is cited for variety rather than monotony. Changeability is one of the features on a longer timescale. That is, the same month or season will often exhibit varying characteristics over the years. A "normal" month, season or year is the exception, rather than the rule.</p>\r\n<p>The basic climate does not result from the predominance of any single controlling weather regime. It is the integrated effect of a large variety of weather patterns. Thus, weather averages in Connecticut are not sufficient for important planning purposes and should be supplemented by more detailed climatological analysis.</p>\r\n<p>Temperature- Despite Connecticut's small size, there is a difference of seven degrees Fahrenheit (&deg; F) in the mean annual temperature from north to south. In the higher elevations of the northwest corner, the mean annual value is about 45, while along the immediate coast it is about 52&deg; F. However, most of the State ranges from 47 to 49 in the eastern and western highlands to near 50&deg; F in the central valley. The State's extreme temperatures are 106 and -32&deg; F.</p>\r\n<p>The greatest contrast of temperature over the State occurs during the winter. The average minimum in January and February is 12 to 14&deg; F in northwestern Litchfield County, as compared with an average of about 22 in coastal sections and 18 in the central valley. The average number of days with minimum temperatures of 0&deg; F or lower is about 12 at the higher elevations, five in the lower uplands and central valley and two less along the shore of Long Island Sound. On average, about 60 to 70 days with a maximum temperature 32&deg; F or lower can be expected in the colder regions of Connecticut, as compared to 25 to 35 days in the coastal sections and the central valley.</p>\r\n<p>Summer temperatures are comparatively uniform over the State. The maximum July temperature averages 82 to 84&deg; F, except where altitude or nearness to the ocean reduces the average by about three degrees Fahrenheit. The central valley experiences the greatest number of 90&deg; F or hotter days. Here, temperatures at or above 90 occur an average of 18 days per year with a variation from five in a cool summer to over 30 for a hot summer. At the highest elevations, there is one such "hot" day annually, on average. The coast averages four to seven days at or above 90 per year. In much of the eastern and western highlands, the occurrence of 90 temperatures is a little less frequent than in the central valley.</p>\r\n<p>Temperatures reach 100&deg; F or higher only rarely. While most of the long-term weather observing sites across the State have recorded temperatures this high, it is only an occasional summer that 100&deg; F or higher occurs generally over Connecticut.</p>\r\n<p>During July, the average minimum temperature ranges from about 58 in the northwestern section of the State to about 66&deg; F in the coastal sections. Over most of the State, average July minimum temperatures are within a degree or two of 62&deg; F.</p>\r\n<p>The freeze-free period ranges from 155 to 170 days over much of the State. In the northwest as well as in local areas of the western and eastern highlands, the freeze-free period is 125 to 135 days. Along the immediate coast, approximately 180 to 210 days elapses between the last spring and first fall freeze. In the major agricultural areas, the growing season begins about mid-April for grasses and hardy crops and mid-May for frost-sensitive crops. It comes to an end for most crops in early October in the interior and by late October for the immediate coast. Due to elevation, special exposure to nocturnal cooling, and other factors, these dates vary considerably in local areas. There is also a good deal of variation among different years in the length of the freeze-free period.</p>\r\n<p>Precipitation- Precipitation tends to become evenly distributed throughout the year in all parts of Connecticut. Low pressure centers and fronts are the principal year-round precipitation producers. Storms moving up the Atlantic coast generally yield the greatest precipitation amounts. In the summer, bands or areas of showers and thunderstorms make up the difference resulting from decreased activity of low pressure systems. Showers and thunderstorms are usually of brief duration and they are often scattered in comparison with general storms, but they yield the heaviest rainfall.</p>\r\n<p>Variations in precipitation from month to month are sometimes extreme. A month yielding five inches or more may by preceded or followed by one with less than two inches of precipitation, in any season. Months with less than one inch are known to occur, as well as those with precipitation in excess of 10 inches. Such large fluctuations, however, are not characteristic of the precipitation supply in Connecticut. Consequently, prolonged droughts and widespread floods are infrequent.</p>\r\n<p>Annual precipitation averages 44 to 48 inches over most of the State. Amounts vary from 41 to 43 inches in the north-central portion to near 54 inches in a small area of the northwest.</p>\r\n<p>Considerable variation in annual precipitation occurs over short distances in northwestern Connecticut. This reflects the topographic differences in the area where valleys around 500 feet mingle with mountains of 1,500 to 2,000 feet elevation. The annual precipitation increases from about 45 inches in the Housatonic River Valley to 54 inches at high elevations less than 10 miles to the east.</p>\r\n<p>While there are no pronounced wet and dry months as in other climates, February and October are relatively dry. The average precipitation for these two months is three inches or slightly less in comparison with close to three and a-half to four inches in the other months. Measurable precipitation falls on an average of one day in three. Periods of five days or more of successive daily precipitation occur a few times during most years. Conversely, extended periods of little or no precipitation are observed nearly every summer or fall, usually lasting from 10 to 20 days.</p>\r\n<p>Rainfall amounts of 4.5 inches in 24 hours have occurred in all parts of Connecticut. Such heavy rainfalls are most common in the summer and fall. The average annual snowfall increases from the coast to the northwest corner of the State, with the greater area of the State receiving three to four feet of snow. Along the coast, the annual totals range from about 20 inches in the southeast to near 35 inches in west and central sections. In some winters, coastal stations will receive less than 15 inches of snow and in other years they receive 60 inches of snowfall. In the highlands of northwestern Connecticut, the average annual amount increases with elevation to over seven feet inches at a few sites. Total snowfalls of over 150 inches have been recorded at higher elevations in particularly snowy winters.</p>\r\n<p>Most of the snow falls in January and February, but in most winters substantial amounts occur from December and March storms as well. Except for the northwest highlands, snowfalls of more than one inch are quite rare before mid-November and after mid-April. April snowfall can total 10 inches or more in the northwest portion of the State every few years.</p>\r\n<p>The average number of days per year with snow on the ground similarly shows an increase from the shore to the northwest. During an average winter, a measurable snow cover is present most of the time from late December to early March in the greater portion of the State. In the immediate coastal areas, a snow cover does not last more than a few days unless a heavy snowstorm is followed by prolonged cold temperatures.</p>\r\n<p>During the colder months the prevailing wind is northwest to north over Connecticut, while April through September south or southwest winds predominate. The mean hourly wind speed ranges from about seven mph in the summer and early fall to about 10 mph in the winter and spring.</p>\r\n<p>An important feature of the climate is the sea breeze along the coast. During the late spring and summer, this onshore wind blows from the cool ocean during the afternoon and penetrates five to 10 miles inland. It is occurs often enough to give lower mean summer maximum temperatures in a narrow coastal belt than prevail over interior lowlands.</p>\r\n<p>Thunderstorms occur on an average of 20 to 30 days per year, with the greatest frequency during the summer months and in the afternoon or evening hours. Occasionally these storms are accompanied by destructive wind and/or hail with damage sustained to crops and property. Nearly every winter a damaging storm of freezing rain occurs. Electricity and telephone lines can be brought down, and trees and utility poles can be snapped. Transportation can be disrupted.</p>\r\n<p>Aside from infrequent tornadoes and hurricanes, coastal storms or "Nor'easters" are the most serious weather hazard in Connecticut. These storms generate very strong winds, heavy rains and produce the greatest snowstorms. If these storms persist at the time of high tide, heavy water damage results along the shore.</p>\r\n<p>An average of one tornado strikes Connecticut each year. The central valley is the most likely part of the State to receive a tornado with the summer being the most likely season of occurrence.</p>\r\n<p>As they move on a path well out over the ocean, tropical systems and their remnants occasionally affect Connecticut during the summer or fall. However, hurricanes have been known to strike the State with full force, The Great New England Hurricane of 1938, Hurricane Gloria in 1985 and to a less extent Hurricane Bob in 1991, for example, resulting in loss of life and enormous property damage.</p>\r\n<p>The Connecticut River shows an annual rise in early spring as the result of melting snow in central and northern New England. Melting of snow combined with heavy rainfall is one of the principal causes of flooding in the Connecticut River basin. A secondary period of flooding is caused by heavy rains which may be associated with a tropical system or its remnants in summer or fall, normally the low water season.</p>\r\n<p>The percentage of possible sunshine averages 55 to 60 percent, ranging from 45 percent in the interior during the months of November, December and January to near 65 along the coast in the summer. The average number of clear days per year is between 100 and 125, with the greatest number per month usually occurring in September and October. An average of 140 cloudy days occurs annually. One or more prolonged periods of cloudy skies are commonly observed during the winter and early spring.</p>\r\n<p>Heavy or dense fog is observed on an average of about 25 times per year in both coastal and inland locations. Along the coast, heavy fog is most common during the late winter and early spring. Meanwhile, inland locations tend to have the greatest number of dense fog days in late summer and fall.</p>\r\n<p>The humidity tends to be the lowest in the spring and highest in the late summer and early fall. While an occasional summer day is uncomfortable due to a combination of heat and humidity, the frequency of such days is much less in Connecticut than in the South and Midwest.</p>\r\n<p>Climate and the Economy- Connecticut is primarily an industrial State, although agriculture is of considerable local and regional importance. The agriculture is of an intensive type with high crop yields.</p>\r\n<p>The climate plays a significant role in the State's agriculture. The patterns of temperature and precipitation are favorable to a wide variety of crops as well as to dairying and poultry raising, which are important in the State. A summer mean temperature of about 70&deg; F in the eastern and western highlands favors the growth of pasture and hay crops. The production of a good hay crop is important as livestock must be barn-fed for several months of the year.</p>\r\n<p>Tobacco for cigars is still grown in portions of the Connecticut River valley, however, on a smaller scale than in years past. Humidity conditions from July through September are advantageous to the air-curing process. There are times, however, when persistent high humidity requires preventative measures against fungi spoilage of the tobacco leaves.</p>\r\n<p>Apples, peaches, strawberries and commercial truck crops are produced principally in the central valley and coastal uplands. There is also production of nursery and greenhouse plants. The climate is satisfactory for a great variety of ornamental flowers, shrubs and trees. Field corn is grown mainly in the dairying sections of the highlands, and the production of small grains is of minor importance. These two crops are used mainly for livestock feed.</p>\r\n<p>Forests cover represents the dominant vegetation. The forests are valuable to the State's economy, not only for wood products, but as a scenic attraction in the autumn and as a preventative factor in the control of erosion and floods.</p>\r\n<p>The ample rainfall, dependable runoff and groundwater supplies have made Connecticut desirable for a great variety of industries. Comfortable summer temperatures and vigorous, but not unduly severe, winter temperatures have also made the State tolerable for the many aspects of an industrial economy.</p>\r\n<p>The tourist and vacation trade represent a considerable part of the economy. The climate is generally agreeable for many recreational activities. Pleasant temperatures and frequent sunny days prevail during the summer and early fall at both seaside and interior resorts. Some winter sports activities are found in the State.</p>\r\n<p>In summary, the climate of Connecticut contributes greatly to its prominence as an industrial, agricultural and recreational area. It is a rich natural asset to the "Constitution State".</p>	40.96667	-73.73333	42.05000	-71.78333	1.337

14	Idaho	ID	45	-115.2	5	<p>Topographic Features- Idaho lies entirely west of the Continental Divide, which forms its boundary for some distance westward from Yellowstone National Park. With a maximum north-south extent of seven degrees of latitude, its east-west extent is six degrees longitude at latitude 42&deg; North, but only one degree of longitude at 49&deg; North. The northern part of the State averages lower in elevation than the much larger central and southern portions, where numerous mountain ranges form barriers to the free flow of air from all directions. In the north, the main barrier is the rugged chain of Bitterroot Mountains forming much of the boundary between Idaho and Montana. The extreme range of elevation in the State is from 710 feet at the Snake River to 12,662 feet at Mt. Borah in Custer County. Comprising rugged mountain ranges, canyons, high grassy valleys, arid plains and fertile lowlands, the State reflects in its topography and vegetation a wide range of climates. Located some 300 miles from the Pacific Ocean, Idaho is, nevertheless influenced by maritime air borne eastward on the prevailing westerly winds. Particularly in winter, the maritime influence is noticeable in the greater average cloudiness, greater frequency of precipitation and mean temperatures, which are above those at the same latitude and altitude in mid-continent. This maritime influence is most marked in the northern part of the State, where the air arrives via the Columbia River Gorge with a greater burden of moisture than at lower latitudes. Eastern Idahoâs climate has a more continental character than the west and north, a fact quite evident not only in the somewhat greater range between winter and summer temperatures, but also in the reversal of the wet winter-dry summer pattern.</p>\r\n<p>Climate is the cumulative representation of weather over a long period of time, covering a decade or longer. The climate of Idaho exhibits substantial variability. Two dominant climate types are a maritime climate most evident in the winter, especially in the northern part of the State, and a continental climate that prevails in the summer. The varied topography of the State, including mountains, valleys and plains, plays an important role in its climate. Current climate information can be obtained through Idaho State Climate Services at http://www.uidaho.edu/~climate.</p>\r\n<p>Temperature- The pattern of average annual temperatures for the State indicates the effect both of latitude and altitude. The highest annual averages are found in the lower elevations of the Clearwater and Little Salmon river basins, and in the stretch of the Snake River Valley from the vicinity of Bliss downstream to Lewiston, including the open valleys of the Boise, Payette and Weiser rivers. At Swan Falls the annual mean is 55 degrees Fahrenheit (&deg; F), the highest in the State. Obsidian, at an elevation of 6,780 feet in Custer County, has the lowest annual average, 35.4&deg; F, of any reporting station, with such places as Sun Valley, Chilly Barton Flat, Grouse, Island Park Dam and Big Creek not far behind. The range between the mean temperatures of the coldest and warmest months of the year varies from less than 40&deg; F at a number of northern stations, to well over 50&deg; F at stations in the higher elevation of the central and eastern parts of the State. In the basin of the Snake River and its tributaries, between Twin Falls and Idaho Falls, monthly mean temperatures of 32&deg; F or lower persist from December through February, while downstream from Twin Falls, at the lower elevations, monthly mean temperatures are freezing or below only in December and January. Low-level stations like Riggins and Lewiston show no month in the year with mean temperature 32&deg; F or lower. In general, it can be said that month means are 32&deg; F or lower at stations above 5,000 feet from November through March; between 4,000 and 5,000 feet, November through February; 3,000 to 4,000 feet, December through February; and 2,000 to 3,000 feet, only one or two months. The diurnal range of temperature is, of course, most extreme in high valleys and in the semiarid plains of the Snake River Valley. The magnitude of diurnal range varies with the season, being lowest in winter when cloudiness is much more prevalent and greatest in the warmer part of the year. At Boise, for example, the average diurnal range is only 14&deg; F in January, but exceeds 30&deg; F in July through September. Official temperature extremes have been measured as low as -60&deg; F at Island Park in January 1943, and as high as 118&deg; F at Orofino in July 1934. The coldest monthly mean minimum temperature has been -20, and the warmest monthly mean maximum 104&deg; F. In summer, periods of extreme heat extending beyond a week are quite rare, and the same can be said of periods of extremely low temperatures in winter. In both cases the normal progress of weather systems across the State usually results in a change at rather frequent intervals. In the realm of extremely low temperatures, two winters stand out in the records for the State, 1937 - 1938 and 1948 -1949. The lowest monthly mean temperatures on record occurred through the State in January 1949, and many stations registered their absolute lowest temperature on record during that month.</p>\r\n<p>Precipitation- To a large extent the source of moisture for precipitation in Idaho is the Pacific Ocean. In summer there are some exceptions to this when moisture-laden air is brought in from the south at high levels to produce thunderstorm activity, particularly in the eastern part of Idaho. The source of this moisture from the south is apparently the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean region. The average precipitation map for Idaho is as complex as the physiography of the State. Partly because of the greater moisture supply in the west winds over the northern part of the State, (less formidable barriers to the west) and partly because of the greater frequency of cyclonic activity in the north, the peaks on the average annual precipitation map are found, however, in nearly all parts of the State at higher elevations. Sizeable areas in the Clearwater, Payette and Boise river basins receive an average of 40 to 50 inches per year, with a few points or small areas receiving in excess of 60 inches. Large areas including the northeastern valleys, much of the Upper Snake River Plains, Central Plains, and the lower elevations of the Southwestern Valleys receive less than 10 inches annually. Seasonal distribution of precipitation shows a very marked pattern of winter maximum and midsummer minimum in the northern and western portions of the State. In the eastern part of the State, however, many reporting stations show maximum monthly amounts in summer and minimum amounts in winter. In the Northeastern Valleys and Eastern Highlands, more than 50 percent of the annual rainfall occurs during the period April through September. Over nearly all of the northern part of the State, however, less than 40 percent of the annual rainfall occurs in this same period, and in portions of the Boise, Payette and Weiser river drainages less than 30 percent of the annual amount comes in that six-month period.</p>\r\n<p>Snowfall distribution is affected both by availability of moisture and by elevation. Annual snowfall totals in Shoshone County have reached nearly 500 inches. The greatest long-term seasonal average was 182 inches at Mullan Pass, while the greatest snow depth (also 182 inches) was recorded at that station on February 20, 1954. The major mountain ranges of the State accumulate a deep snow cover during the winter months, and the release of water from the melting snowpack in late spring furnishes irrigation water for several million acres, mainly within the Snake River Basin above Weiser. Irrigation water supplies are nearly always plentiful, except on some of the smaller projects where storage facilities are inadequate. Hydroelectric power generated in Idaho provides some of the least expensive power in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>Floods in Idaho occur most often during the period of seasonal snowmelt in spring, particularly in April and May. A few areas in the State are actually flooded or threatened by floodwaters nearly every year. The Kootenai River valley, in the vicinity of Bonners Ferry, is one such area, and another is the Snake River upstream from Idaho Falls in the vicinity of Roberts and Menan. Much has been done to minimize the damage from such seasonal floods through the construction of reservoirs and other flood-control facilities. So-called "out-of-season" floods do occur occasionally at a number of points in the State. For example, wintertime floods have occurred on the Payette, Weiser, Little Salmon and Wood rivers' portions of the upper Boise and Payette basins. Flash floods on small streams, or occasionally in ravines or dry gulches, occur a few times each year as the result of heavy rains associated with thunderstorms. Two areas that seem to be particularly susceptible to this type of flooding lie between Downey and Pocatello in the southeast, and in the north-central part of the State between Grangeville and Moscow.</p>\r\n<p>The diurnal range of relative humidity generally follows a pattern that is the reverse of the diurnal temperature curve. Precipitation or fog interferes with such a pattern, but the averages show maximum humidity at the time of minimum temperature and vice versa. In winter, average relative humidities are considerably higher than during hot weather. Human comfort during the summer months is greatly affected by the moisture content of the air. In Idaho, where maximum temperatures above 90&deg; F are not uncommon in July and August, humidity at the time of maximum temperature is usually below 25 percent, and often down to 15 percent or lower. With any kind of air movement, the higher temperatures are quite within the range of adjustment of the human system. The low relative humidity of summer also permits widespread use of evaporation-type coolers. Field-drying of hay is facilitated by the dry air, especially when air movement is sufficient. Some work has been done on the drying of corn and grain without the addition of heat, but in the season when this activity is carried on, the days are shorter and the periods of low relative humidity are rather brief.</p>\r\n<p>Fogs in Idaho are extremely variable, and statistics are available where regular National Weather Service Offices are maintained at airports, Boise, Lewiston and Pocatello. At Boise, heavy fog (visibility 1/4 mile or less) is experienced on an average of 19 days per year, with a maximum of six occurrences in January. The year-to-year variation is considerable. Lewiston averages 21 days with heavy fog per year, with a peak of five days in December. Pocatello has an average of 17 days of heavy fog per year, the maximum monthly average being four in January. Along with fogs, particularly if they persist for a few days, rime ice occasionally forms on power and communication lines. These occurrences are relatively infrequent.</p>\r\n<p>Windstorms are not uncommon in Idaho, but the State has no destructive storms such as hurricanes, and an extremely small incidence of tornadoes. Windstorms associated with cyclonic systems, and their cold fronts, do some damage to trees each year, often causing temporary disruption of power and communication facilities, but only minor damage to structures in most instances. Storms of this type may occur at any time from October into July, while during the summer months strong winds almost invariably come with thunderstorms. Hail damage in Idaho is very small in comparison with damage in areas of the central part of the United States. Often the hail that occurs does not grow to a size larger than one-half inch in diameter, and the areas affected are usually small. Quite often hail comes during early spring storms, when it is mostly of the small, soft variety with a limited damaging effect. Later when crops are more mature and more susceptible to serious damage, hail occurs in widely scattered spots in connection with summer thunderstorms. The incidence of summer thunderstorms is greatest in mountainous areas, where lightning often causes serious forest and range fires.</p>\r\n<p>The annual average percentage of possible sunshine ranges from about 50 in the north to about 70 in the south. Winter, with its frequent periods of cloudy weather, has about 40 percent of possible sunshine in the large open valleys of the south and less than 30 percent in the north. In July and August the average percentage rises to the upper 80s in the southwest and to near 80 in the east and north.</p>\r\n<p>The growing season (freeze-free period), like the average temperature, varies greatly throughout the State because of differences in elevations, soil type, topography and vegetative cover. Year-to-year variations are also considerable in many areas. The area in the immediate vicinity of Lewiston has the longest growing season, approximately 200 days, followed by a sizeable area in the central Snake, and lower Boise, Payette and Weiser river basins with 150 days or more. Upstream along the Snake, the growing season shortens, but is still of the order of 125 days in the Pocatello-Idaho Falls area. A few high valleys have no month without freezing temperatures and the land is used entirely for grazing.</p>\r\n<p>Climate and the Economy- Nearly three and a half million acres of farmland are irrigated in Idaho. The upper portion of the Snake River Basin, upstream from the vicinity of Bliss, has large areas of both irrigated and non-irrigated farmland. At some of the higher elevations in the eastern part of the State, the land is used primarily for livestock ranches and for growing seed potatoes, hay, oats, barley and wheat. At somewhat lower elevations, one of the principal crops is the Idaho Russet potato, for which the upper Snake Basin is famous. Approximately 90 percent of Idahoâs potatoes are grown on irrigated land on the Snake River Plain. The area between Gooding and Minidoka Counties is devoted to the production of dry, edible beans. Sugar beets, which rank high in importance because of the large per-acre gross income, are grown on a large scale. Hay, consisting primarily of alfalfa, occupies more than one-third of the crop area in this part of the State. Estimates show only 1,000 dairies in the whole State of Idaho. However, the dairy industry has grown tremendously in the past 15 years to become Idaho's most important agricultural commodity. Field corn acreage has increased in the Magic Valley, mostly to produce silage as feed for the growing dairy industry. According to 2001 county estimates, 80 percent of the 111,000 acres planted in corn east of and including Bliss were harvested as silage. From the vicinity of Bliss on down to Weiser, the Idaho portion of the Snake River Basin contains nearly three-quarters of a million acres of irrigated land, which is a comparatively small percentage of the total acreage of farms and stock ranches. Farms in Southwest Idaho are generally smaller than other areas of the State; however, a large variety of crops is grown. Sugar beets, onions, grapes, peaches, apples and alfalfa seed all contribute to the areaâs agricultural income. Most irrigation in this area is furrow irrigation while wheel lines and pivots are more common to the east. Dairy products also constitute an important part of the areaâs output. The Clark Fork and Clearwater drainages of northern Idaho, like the central Snake Basin in the southwest, have a relatively small percentage of their total areas in croplands. But the Camas and Nez Perce prairies, which form the eastern fringe of the famous Palouse dry-farming area, are highly productive. Forty-five percent of Idahoâs winter wheat output comes from this area, as well as significant quantities of lentils and Kentucky bluegrass seed. Spring wheat, barley, peas and a few other crops are also grown, nearly all without irrigation. More information is available through the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service at http://www.usda.gov/nass/</p>\r\n<p>Approximately two million acres of forest lie within the eastern part of the State, mostly in the higher mountainous areas. Lumbering here is done only on a small scale. The southwestern portion of the State has a greater forested area, running into several million acres, and lumbering is a more important phase of the economy than it is farther east. The northern part of Idaho, because of its higher annual precipitation, is more heavily forested than the southern portion of the State, and lumbering has long occupied a prominent place in the economy of the area. Lewiston, Potlatch and Coeur dâAlene are among the sites of important forest product industries. One of the finest white pine stands in the country lies in northern Idaho, principally in Clearwater and Shoshone counties.</p>\r\n<p>Recreational resources are abundant in Idaho. The large lakes of the north, particularly Coeur dâAlene, Pend Oreille and Priest Lake, provide wonderful boating and fishing, as well as serving as sites for summer homes and camps. Payette Lake in Valley County and Bear Lake on the Utah-Idaho border furnish recreational facilities for thousands of persons each year. Henryâs Lake in Fremont County furnishes some of the best trout fishing in the State. Numerous reservoirs have added greatly to the recreational facilities of the State, and hundreds of mountain lakes and streams furnish almost unlimited opportunity for camping, hiking, fishing and hunting. Much of Idahoâs area lies within boundaries of several National forests, and the Forest Service has set aside large tracts as wilderness areas. Excellent hunting for deer, elk, bear and Rocky Mountain sheep and goats is afforded the hardier individuals who enter these more inaccessible areas. The three principal areas are the Sawtooth Wilderness, embracing the Salmon and Boise rivers; the much larger Idaho Wilderness, principally between the middle and south forks of the Salmon River; and the Selway Wilderness area in the upper Clearwater drainage. Idaho is a winter recreation paradise for alpine, cross-country skiing, telemark skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing and snowmobiling. Since Sun Valley Ski Resort opened in 1935 as the first destination ski resort in America, Idaho has offered visitors a wide variety of winter recreation opportunities from sledding to sleigh rides, from ice fishing to ice skating. Sixteen ski resorts now operate across the State. Then in the spring and summer, Idaho boasts of some of the best whitewater rafting rivers to be found. The Salmon River denoted the "River-of-No-Return" by explorers Lewis and Clark, ranks as one of the top 10 whitewater rivers in the world.</p>	42.00000	-117.00000	49.00000	-111.00000	0.562

19	Kentucky	KY	38.3	-85.1	6	<p>Topographic Features- Site and situation are keys to understanding Kentucky's climate and its role in the State's economy. Kentucky is centrally situated in the eastern half of the United States. It lies midway between the Gulf of Mexico to the south and the Great Lakes to the north and between the Atlantic Coast to the east and the Great Plains to the west. Kentucky site is characterized by a physical landscape covering more than 40,000 square miles and extending more than 400 miles from the Mississippi River in the west toward the Appalachian Mountains in the east. It is about 175 miles at its greatest extent from north to south, and it narrows to the west. Elevation increases from less than 400 feet above sea level along the Mississippi River to higher than 4,000 feet in the southeast. However, 75 percent of the State lies below 1,000 feet above sea level, and 99 percent is less than 2,000 feet in elevation. With the exception of a small area along the western margin of Kentucky that drains directly into the Mississippi, Kentucky's nearly 90,000 miles of streams and rivers drain to the north and west into the Ohio River.</p>\r\n<p>Kentucky is a State of diverse regional landscapes. Physical processes have shaped distinctive landforms, and people have used these in a variety of ways to make a living. The influence and importance of climate varies with the physical and economic character of these regional landscapes.</p>\r\n<p>The Jackson Purchase Region of far western Kentucky includes alluvial plains and small hills. Low lying areas stretching south and east from the Ohio and Mississippi rivers are nearly flat and thus poorly drained. Lakes, ponds and other wetlands are common. Local relief is generally less than 100 feet. The soil is fertile, and agriculture helps to sustain the region's small rural communities. Corn, soybeans and winter wheat are the dominant crops. Paducah, situated along the Ohio River, is the region's largest industrial and commercial center.</p>\r\n<p>The Western Kentucky Coal Field Region lies east of the Jackson Purchase. It is part of a basin that reaches southward from Illinois and Indiana and is endowed with coal and oil resources. Relief increases toward the margin of the basin, and much of this area is forested. Alluvial deposits become prominent in proximity to the Ohio River. As in the Jackson Purchase, the nearly flat land is poorly drained and wetlands are evident. Fertile soils support extensive production of corn and soybeans. Agriculture and mining have supported the growth of many rural communities. The cities of Owensboro and Henderson, both located along the Ohio River, are the primary centers of business and industry.</p>\r\n<p>Kentucky is perhaps best known for its Bluegrass Region. Located in north central Kentucky, the core of the Bluegrass is a gently rolling karst plain characterized by sinkholes, sinking streams and springs. The region's limestone-purified water is recognized as a key location factor for Kentucky's distilleries. Weathering of limestone has produced the State's most fertile soil, and the horse farms sprawling across rich pasturelands are a Kentucky icon. Relief increases gradually and the soil becomes less fertile toward the margin of the Bluegrass. Tobacco is also an important source of income for farmers throughout much of the region. The Knobs Region, identified by dispersed, often conical hills that have steep slopes but rise only about 500 feet above the surrounding plain, surrounds the Bluegrass. The city of Lexington lies in the heart of the Bluegrass, while the outer Bluegrass includes the Ohio River cities of Louisville and Covington. This is the most highly urbanized and industrialized region in Kentucky.</p>\r\n<p>Farther to the east, the Eastern Kentucky Coal Field Region is distinguished by its more rugged terrain. Most of the region lies on the Appalachian Plateau that rises gradually from the west toward the Appalachian Mountains. The plateau has been carved by water to form a landscape distinguished by a maze of hills, valleys and hollows. The hills are less than 2,000 feet in elevation, and local relief is several hundred feet. Pine Mountain trends across the southeastern margin of Kentucky where the plateau reaches the Appalachian Mountains. Kentucky's highest point, 4,139 feet, is the peak of Black Mountain along the border with Virginia. The Eastern Kentucky Coal Field is well endowed with natural resources, including abundant coal deposits, natural gas and extensive forests that support the region's economy. Strip mining has significantly altered the landscape in some areas. Forests include a mixture of hardwood and softwood species. Agriculture includes a mix of tobacco, corn, hay, and pasture but is practiced on a very limited scale. Soils are not particularly fertile, and only small areas of flat land are available for cultivation. This region is also the least industrialized. Ashland, the largest city in the region, is located along the Ohio River. Cities located throughout the region are small and largely confined to narrow valleys and more gently sloping hillsides.</p>\r\n<p>The Pennyroyal Region stretches across southern Kentucky from the Jackson Purchase to the Bluegrass and Eastern Kentucky Coal Field. The Dripping Springs Escarpment of the Pennyroyal encircles much of the Western Kentucky Coal Field and falls onto a karst plain. Sinkholes, sinking streams and springs are characteristic of the rolling landscape. Mammoth Cave, the world's longest cave system is located in the region. Much of the escarpment is forested, while the karst plain supports a variety of agricultural uses. In its western and southern extent, corn, soybeans and winter wheat are grown. Farther east and north, pastureland and hay become more common, and significantly less land is devoted to grain production. Tobacco is an important cash crop throughout much of the region. Bowling Green, a diversified city that capitalizes on its location between Louisville and Nashville, Tennessee, is the Pennyroyal's largest city. Hopkinsville and a number of other smaller cities are dispersed throughout the region. Tourism is important in the Mammoth Cave area. The Land between the Lakes region is located at the western extent of the region, and Lake Cumberland is located near the eastern extent.</p>\r\n<p>The climate of Kentucky reflects the interplay of several locational influences. Kentucky's inland location contributes to a continental influence which acting alone tends to produce a large seasonal temperature range between summer and winter. Meanwhile, its position north of the Gulf of Mexico contributes a tropical marine influence that moderates temperatures and yields ample precipitation. Kentucky's mid-latitude position places it in a region where weather can be highly variable. While prevailing surface winds are southerly and light, upper level westerly winds steer frontal systems across the State. These systems bring warm, moist air from the south, followed by cooler and drier air from the north. At a broader scale, Kentucky's climate is influenced by interactions involving the oceans and atmosphere. While these influences originate thousands of miles away, they may contribute to significant variations in Kentucky's climate on a seasonal or annual timeframe.</p>\r\n<p>Temperature- Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 degrees Fahrenheit (&deg; F) in the northeast to 59 in the southwest, but there is significant seasonal variation in temperature. Summer days are typically sunny, warm and humid. Most areas of the State receive more than 60 percent of available sunshine during summer. The average daily high temperature for July increases from about 86 in the east to 90&deg; F in the west. High temperatures exceed 90&deg; F an average of 20 days per year in the north and east and 40 or more days in the south and west. Temperatures occasionally exceed 100&deg; F. The passage of frontal systems is less frequent during summer, so weather patterns are typically more persistent. But when they do arrive, cold fronts bring pleasant conditions that may persist for a few days. Winters are rarely harsh. In January, average daily high temperatures increase from 38 in the north to 44&deg; F in the south. Cloudy skies are more frequent in winter, as most areas receive near 40 percent of available sunshine. Polar air masses occasionally affect Kentucky for short periods. Temperatures dip below 0&deg; F an average of about five days in the north and two days in the south. Spring and fall are generally pleasant seasons, though temperatures can change dramatically with the passage of frontal systems. The diurnal temperature range is about 20&deg; F during the summer and winter but increases to near 25&deg; F during the spring and fall, when warm days and cool nights are prevalent.</p>\r\n<p>Kentucky's growing season varies across the State. The average date of the last spring freeze ranges from early April in the southwest to early May in the northeast. Meanwhile, the average date of the first fall freeze extends from early October in the northeast to late October in the southwest. The average length of the frost-free period varies from about 165 days in the northeast to 200 days in the southwest, but the average can vary with local topography.</p>\r\n<p>Precipitation- Precipitation is generally plentiful enough to meet agricultural needs and the needs of municipalities that serve industrial, commercial and residential users. Average annual precipitation ranges from 42 inches in the north to 52 inches in the south. Much of the range is due to a strong precipitation gradient during the winter season. Summer precipitation patterns are less pronounced. Fall is normally Kentucky's dry season, while the spring season is typically the wettest. But, precipitation is well distributed throughout the year. Thunderstorms are responsible for much of the rainfall during summer, and they often bring intense rainfall that may be highly localized. Rainfall intensities generally increase toward the southwest. Rates exceeding one inch per hour are not unusual and 24-hour totals of five inches or more occur an average of about one in ten years at a given location. Meanwhile, it is common for a location to go for a period of two weeks or more without measurable precipitation in the summer or fall. Snowfall is most likely from December to March, but it occasionally occurs as early as October or as late as April. Seasonal amounts average from near 10 inches in the south to more than 20 inches in the north. Amounts are highly variable from year to year. In some years, a single heavy snowfall event may represent a large percentage of the seasonal total. Across southern Kentucky, seasonal totals of less than five inches are fairly common, while totals of more than 20 inches are infrequent. Northern areas rarely receive less than 10 inches of snow and occasionally receive as much as 40 inches or more. Snowcover seldom persists for more than a week in the south or more than two weeks in the north.</p>\r\n<p>Kentucky's climate is a valuable natural resource. However, like other states, Kentucky is vulnerable to a variety of hazards associated with its climate. These hazards pose threats to life and property, and they can disrupt economic activity.</p>\r\n<p>Thunderstorms are an important element of Kentucky's climate. They can occur throughout the year but are most common in the warmer months. The number of thunderstorm days averages about 55 in the west and closer to 40 in the east. While thunderstorms are a vital source of rainfall in the summer season, they can also bring severe weather, including damaging winds, hail and tornadoes. Fewer than 10 tornadoes are recorded in most years. Tornadoes are most frequent in April, but they can occur in any month.</p>\r\n<p>Winter storms producing heavy snow occasionally affect Kentucky. Heavy snow is normally associated with storm systems that originate in the southwest, are fueled by Gulf of Mexico moisture, and track toward the northeast. Instead of snow, a winter storm may bring freezing rain that produces significant icing, but such events are infrequent. Intense winter storms are sometimes followed by cold waves that bring temperatures of 0&deg; F or colder.</p>\r\n<p>Flooding can be widespread or highly localized across Kentucky. Widespread flooding is most common in the winter and spring seasons when moisture-laden frontal systems can drop heavy rains over large areas. Flooding in the late summer and early fall can occur due to the remnants of a tropical system that tracks over or close to the State. Intense thunderstorm precipitation can cause flash flooding. While flash floods can occur anywhere across the State, they are a greater threat in areas of rough terrain and narrow stream valleys.</p>\r\n<p>Droughts are a recurrent feature of Kentucky's climate. They occur on an average of about one year in 10 and usually become evident during the growing season when temperatures are warm and the demand for water is high. Since fall is normally a dry season, recovery usually does not occur until winter, and in some cases a drought may persist for more than a year. Droughts often intensify during the summer due to a strong Bermuda High, which blocks the movement of frontal systems across the State, inhibits the development of thunderstorms, and contributes to the intensity of heat waves.</p>\r\n<p>Climate and the Economy- The effects of climate on the economy are multifaceted. Seasonal norms of temperature and precipitation help to shape the structure of many activities, such as agriculture, forestry, recreation and tourism, which draw directly from elements of the physical environment. Meanwhile, other aspects of climate, such as the frequency and intensity of thunderstorms, snow and ice storms, droughts, heat waves and cold waves, have more pervasive effects on daily operations of business and industry.</p>\r\n<p>Agriculture is the historical foundation of rural communities across much of the State. Slightly over one-half of Kentucky's land is used for agriculture. Prime farmland is concentrated in the alluvial soils of Kentucky's river and stream valleys, and the soils formed from limestone in karst regions are also fertile. Harvested cropland accounts for slightly over one-third of agricultural land, while pastureland and woodlands account for progressively smaller portions. Warm temperatures and precipitation that is spread throughout the growing season favor plant growth. Only a small percentage of cropland is irrigated. The choice of crops largely reflects soils and topography, though climate and markets are also factors. The largest percentage of harvested cropland is used for hay, about equal amounts are used for corn and soybeans, and a smaller amount is planted in winter wheat. Kentucky's most valuable crop, tobacco, is grown on small plots. Pastureland and some harvested crops are used to feed beef and dairy cattle and hogs. The State's richest pastureland is home to Kentucky's famous horse farms. Farm operations are directly impacted by storms that can cause localized crop damage or limit access to fields for planting or harvesting. Likewise, drought and extreme temperature variations can adversely affect both crops and livestock.</p>\r\n<p>Forests cover nearly half of Kentucky. But forestland is much more extensive in eastern Kentucky where there is little cleared land except in river and stream valleys. The composition of Kentucky's forests is a reflection of the State's moderate climate. Species associated with both northern and southern latitudes are found in abundance, and the microclimates that vary with slope and aspect in the eastern mountains contribute to diverse forest ecosystems. Commercially valuable species include red oak, white oak and yellow poplar, along with less abundant species such as cedar, ash, maple, hickory and walnut. Kentucky's timber resources support sawmills and a variety of industries, including furniture and hardwood flooring, across the State. Forests tend to be resilient to short-term climatic variations, but prolonged periods of drought can stress timber stands and increase the threat of forest fires.</p>\r\n<p>Natural resources contribute to Kentucky's economic development. Agricultural and timber resources provide inputs for related food products and wood products industries. Meanwhile, abundant coal reserves, along with smaller reserves of oil and natural gas, fuel energy production. Low energy rates are important in the chemical and metals industries, including aluminum and steel. Combined with only moderate energy needs for heating and cooling, Kentucky's low energy rates contribute to a low cost of living. Kentucky's rivers and reservoirs are used to generate electricity in parts of the State, and surface water is relied upon heavily to meet the needs of communities, large and small across the State. Providers of water and electricity must be able to cope with natural fluctuations in supply and demand tied to climatic variability.</p>\r\n<p>Kentucky's location is advantageous for manufacturing. Not only does it possess a central geographic location in the eastern United States, net migration into the South has increased its centrality with respect to the distribution of population. Motor vehicles manufactured in Kentucky's many assembly plants are shipped to widely distributed markets. The adoption of just-in-time inventory systems makes the reliability of transportation services critical for delivering parts to manufacturers and distributing products to market. Kentucky benefits from a lower frequency of snow days and shorter duration of cold waves than more northern locations, while having a lower frequency of thunderstorms that can disrupt transportation schedules than areas farther south. This combination of location and climate contributes to making Kentucky an important node for transportation services.</p>\r\n<p>Service industries form a vital component of Kentucky's economy. Traditional service industries that derive value from the physical environment, including tourism and recreation, prosper in Kentucky's climate. Outdoor activities, such as golf, hiking, hunting, fishing and water sports, can be enjoyed throughout much of the year. Other business and consumer services are distributed with respect to local demand. A few examples are Kentucky's prominent health services industry, along with legal services, education services and retailing. While these are much less sensitive to climate, consumer behavior is known to be affected by variations in climate. Innovations in communications technology make it increasingly possible for firms to deliver services electronically, without great concern for transportation access to their markets. Kentucky's ability to attract service providers that depend on information technology is more dependent on quality of life issues, of which climate is an integral part.</p>\r\n<p>Climate plays an integral role in Kentucky's economy. In a competitive economic environment, the ability of business and industry to respond to both short and long term climatic variability can be critical.</p>	36.50000	-89.56667	39.15000	-81.96667	2.223

25	Minnesota	MN	46.44	-93.36	5	<p>Topographic Features- The State of Minnesota covers 84,068 square miles. There are 11,842 lakes greater than 10 acres. The State's jurisdiction covers 2,546 square miles of Lake Superior. Minnesota extends about 400 miles south to north between latitudes 43.5 and 49&deg; North, and averages 275 miles east to west between longitudes 89.5 and 97&deg; West.</p>\r\n<p>Elevations are less than 1,200 feet near each of the three major rivers, the: Red, Minnesota and Mississippi (except in the northern part). There are three areas where elevations are greater than 1,600 feet: the Iron Range, paralleling the north shore of Lake Superior; the Coteau Des Prairies (also known as Buffalo Ridge), extending out of South Dakota across the southwest portion of the State; and a small area in the Lake Itasca region. The highest point above sea level, Eagle Mountain, in the extreme northeast portion of the State, is 2,301 feet, and the lowest is 602 feet along the shores of Lake Superior. Minnesota can be considered to have a continental divide in three directions: drainage is toward Hudson Bay to the north; toward the Atlantic Ocean to the east; and toward the Gulf of Mexico to the south.</p>\r\n<p>Temperature- Minnesota has a continental-type climate and is subject to frequent outbreaks of continental polar air throughout the year, with occasional Arctic outbreaks during the cold season. Occasional periods of prolonged heat occur during summer, particularly in the southern portion of Minnesota, when warm air pushes northward from the Gulf of Mexico and the southwestern United States. Pacific Ocean air masses that move across the Western United States produce comparatively mild and dry weather at all seasons.</p>\r\n<p>Mean annual temperatures range from 36 degrees Fahrenheit (&deg; F) in the extreme north to 49 degrees along the Mississippi River in the southeast. State temperature extremes range from -60 to 114&deg; F.</p>\r\n<p>Monthly mean temperatures vary from 85 in the southwest to -11&deg; F in the northwest. Mean temperatures during January in the northern portions of the State average near 4&deg; F; this is 10 degrees colder than temperatures recorded at stations near Lake Superior and in southern Minnesota.</p>\r\n<p>The mean temperature in July for the State averages about 70&deg; F in most places but this is five to 10 degrees warmer than at stations near Lake Superior. Thus, Lake Superior stations are cool in summer and relatively warm in winter.</p>\r\n<p>Dew point temperatures in most areas range from a high of 70&deg; F in July to a low of 6 in January. However, the dew point temperatures average about five to 10 degrees lower in the extreme northern portion of the State at all seasons.</p>\r\n<p>Precipitation- Although the total precipitation is important, its distribution during the growing season is even more significant. For the most part, native vegetation grows for seven months (April to October) and row crops grow for five months (May through September). During the latter five-month period, approximately two-thirds of the annual precipitation occurs. Mean annual precipitation is 35 inches in extreme southeast Minnesota, an amount that gradually decreases to 19 inches in the extreme northwest portion of the State. At most locations there have been months with no precipitation recorded. Statewide, two of the driest years were 1910 and 1976, while two of the wettest were 1965 and 1977.</p>\r\n<p>Seasonal snowfall averages near 70 inches in the highlands along the north shore of Lake Superior in northeast Minnesota, gradually decreases to 40 inches along the Iowa border in the south, and is around 40 inches along the North Dakota and South Dakota borders in the west. Snow cover of one inch or more over the State occurs on an average of about 110 days annually, ranging from 85 days in the south to 140 days in the north.</p>\r\n<p>Heavy snowfalls of greater than 4 inches are common any time from mid-November through mid-April. Heavy snowfalls with blizzard conditions affect the State on the average about two times each winter. The most devastating blizzards were those of January 11 - 13, 1888, and of November 11 - 12, 1940, which resulted in the loss of many lives and a heavy toll of livestock. Blizzard conditions are when visibilities are reduced to less than 1/4 mile for several hours due to falling and/or blowing snow. The wind must be at least 35 mph. Another memorable blizzard occurred on October 31, 1991 and is known as the "Halloween Blizzard". The Twin Cities received 28.4 inches of snow from this storm which lasted until November 3.</p>\r\n<p>Conditions of severe drought with an annual Palmer Drought Index of -3 or lower are expected on the average about once in 10 years in southwest and west central Minnesota, to about once in 25 years over eastern Minnesota. The northeast part of the state experiences severe drought about once in 50 years.</p>\r\n<p>Thunderstorms generally cause more damage to property in Minnesota than any other weather factor. The annual frequency of thunderstorm days is about 45 days in southern Minnesota, decreasing to about 30 days along the Canadian border. Generally, 80 percent or more of these storms occur during the heavier rainfall months--from May through September. Damaging local windstorms, tornadoes, hail, and heavy rains sometimes occur with better-developed thunderstorms.</p>\r\n<p>The "tornado month" in the State is June, with July next, and then May. During these three months, over 75 percent of all tornadoes occur; May has about 17 percent, June around 33 percent, and July approximately 28 percent. Tornadoes have never been reported in the State during December, January and February. The average number reported annually is 35. The southern half of Minnesota has three to four times as many tornadoes as the northern half of the State. The deadliest Minnesota tornado of record was the Saint Cloud-Sauk Rapids tornado on April 14, 1886, when 74 lives were lost. The most damaging tornadoes were those occurring in the northern part of Minneapolis in the late afternoon of May 6, 1965, causing about $280 million (2001 figure) in damage.</p>\r\n<p>The frequency of hail shows a high of three to four days annually in southwestern Minnesota, decreasing to near two days in the northern portion of the State. The month with the most hail is June, with May next, and then July. During these three months, about 60 percent of the hail occurs; June has 24 percent, May has 20 percent and July has 16 percent. The size of the hail reported is generally in the pea to dime-sized category, with several reports annually of baseball-size and larger.</p>\r\n<p>Freezing rain and glaze storms are not numerous, but do coat the roads several times each season in Minnesota. The more severe ice storms cause extensive damage to utility lines and trees; such storms are not as common in the northern part of the State as they are in the south and southeast portions.</p>\r\n<p>Local flash flooding can be very destructive along the steep bluffs of Lake Superior and the hilly terrain and narrow valleys of southeast Minnesota; however, flash flooding can occur anywhere in Minnesota. Flash flooding (defined as a six inches or more rain in 24 hours) occurs on average, three times a year somewhere in the state.</p>\r\n<p>The agricultural areas of Minnesota can be divided into three approximately equal parts: national and State forest land, farmlands for row crops, and farmlands for pasture and hay. Corn is the major crop by acreage, followed by about equal acreages of: hay, oats and soybeans. Farm income from marketing shows that about two-thirds of the total comes from livestock and with one-third from field crops.</p>\r\n<p>The freeze-free (air temperatures greater than 32&deg; F) growing season generally starts about the second week of May in the south and the first of June in the north and ends about mid-September in the north and during the first week of October in the south. The area in southeast Minnesota along the Mississippi River has the longest growing season, approximately 160 days. The southern one-third of the State averages from 140 to 150 days. The North Central Division and the ridges of the Iron Range average a growing season of only about 90 to 100 days. There are bog areas in northern Minnesota that have reported freezing temperatures every month of the year.</p>\r\n<p>The average number of Growing Degree Days (GDD) over the freeze-free growing season for agricultural areas is less than 2,000 in the north, but ranges to near 2,700 GDD in the south (The GDD is derived from the excess of daily mean temperatures over 50&deg; F; minimum temperatures cannot fall below 50 nor can maximum temperatures rise above 86 for computational purposes.)</p>\r\n<p>Annual lake evaporation varies from 35 inches in a year in the Southwest to about 20 inches in Northeast Division. Annual pan evaporation varies from about 50 inches in a year in the southwest to less than 30 inches in the northeast. The actual daily evapotranspiration (evaporation from land and plant surfaces) or ET averages about 0.15 inch of water during the months of June, July and August for all of the State except the North Central and Northeast Divisions. Row crops average approximately 20 inches of ET in a year; however, the average annual potential ET (adequate soil moisture at all times) is near 24 inches.</p>\r\n<p>Solar radiation varies from an average of about 120 langleys a day in December to near 570 langleys a day in July. (The langley is a unit of energy per unit area commonly employed in radiation theory; it is equal to one gram-calorie per square centimeter.) Sunshine amounts vary from a low in November of nearly 40 percent of possible sunshine hours to a high of about 70 percent in July, with an annual average of 58 percent. The daylight length varies from about 8.5 hours in December to 16 hours in June.</p>\r\n<p>The soil freezes about the first week of December and thaws about mid-April. Average maximum freeze depth in the State ranges from three to four feet in the south to five to six feet in the north, exclusive of forested regions where the freezing depth is ordinarily much shallower.</p>\r\n<p>Climate and the Economy- Minnesota climate, in conjunction with some 15,000 lakes interspersed in forests and wooded areas, produces an almost ideal environment for variety of recreational activities. The summer season (May through August), with its warm days and cool nights, attracts summer vacationers.</p>\r\n<p>Common activities are camping, fishing, swimming, boating, canoeing and hiking. The recreational activity in the fall season (September through November) is dominated by the hunters. Deer, moose, pheasant, duck, geese, grouse and occasionally bear are the principal targets. For the non-hunters, autumn is beautiful for the annual change of the summer leaves to hues of yellow, orange and red.</p>\r\n<p>The winter season (December through March) has sufficient snowfalls and low temperatures to maintain conditions for skiing, snowmobiling, skating (hockey) and ice fishing. The transition season is the month of April when the snow and ice melt.</p>\r\n<p>A special recreational area in northern Minnesota has been set aside and regulated for canoeing only. This area: known as the Boundary Water Canoe Area, is a 110-mile canoe region that extends along the Canadian border and into Canada. There are also 72 state parks and numerous other camping facilities that offer camping and recreation.</p>	43.56667	-97.20000	49.38333	-89.56667	0.854

30	Nevada	NV	38.5019	-117.0226	5	<p>Topographic Features- Nevada is predominately a plateau. The eastern part has an average elevation of between 5,000 and 6,000 feet. The western part is between 3,800 and 5,000 feet, the lower limit being in the vicinity of Pyramid Lake and Carson Sink. The southern part is generally between 2,000 and 3,000 feet. From the lower elevations of the western portion there is a fairly rapid rise westward toward the summits of the Sierra Nevada. The southwestern part slopes down toward Death Valley, California; the southern portion slopes toward the channel of the Colorado River, which is less than 1,000 feet above sea level. The northeastern part slopes toward the north draining into the Snake River and thence the Columbia River Basin.</p>\r\n<p>The Nevada plateau has several mountain ranges, most of them 50 to 100 miles long, running generally north-south. The only east-west range is in the northeast where it forms the southern limit of the Columbia River Basin. Except for this small drainage area and another limited region in the southeast which drains into the Colorado River, the State lies within the Great Basin, and the waters of its streams disappear into sinks or flow into lakes with no outlets. Nevada has great climatic diversity, ranging from scorching lowland desert in the south to cool mountain forests in the north. Its varied and rugged topography, mountain ranges and narrow valleys range in elevation from about 1,500 to more than 10,000 feet above sea level. Wide local variations of temperature and precipitation are common. The principal climatic features are bright sunshine, small annual precipitation (averaging nine inches in the valleys and deserts) heavy snowfall in the higher mountains, clean, dry air and exceptionally large daily ranges of temperature.</p>\r\n<p>Temperature- The mean annual temperatures vary from about 45 degrees Fahrenheit (&deg; F) in the northeast to about 50 in the west and central areas and to the middle 60s in the south. In the northeast, summers are short and hot; winters are long and cold. In the west, summers are also short and hot, but the winters are only moderately cold; in the south the summers are long and hot and the winters short and mild. Long periods of extremely cold weather are rare, primarily because the mountains east and north of the State act as a barrier to the intensely cold continental arctic air masses. However, on occasion, a cold air mass spills over these barriers and produces prolonged cold waves.</p>\r\n<p>There is strong surface heating during the day and rapid nighttime cooling because of the dry air, resulting in wide daily ranges in temperature. Even after the hottest days, the nights are usually cool. The average range between the highest and the lowest daily temperatures is about 30 to 35 degrees. Daily ranges are larger in summer than the winter. Extreme temperatures have ranged from 125 to -50&deg; F.</p>\r\n<p>Summer temperatures above 100&deg; F occur rather frequently in the south and occasionally over the rest of the State. Humidity is usually low so that the higher temperatures are less disagreeable in Nevada than in more humid climates. During the warmer season of the year, air conditioning is used in large percentage of the commercial establishments and in many homes. Because of the dryness of the air, evaporative coolers operate very efficiently in the homes of Nevada's residents. Over the northern and central portions of the State, freezes begin early in the autumn and continue until late in the spring. The freeze-free season varies from less than 70 days in the northwest and northeast to about 140 days in the west and south-central areas, to over 225 days in the south.</p>\r\n<p>Precipitation- Nevada lies on the eastern, lee, side of the Sierra Nevada Range, a massive mountain barrier that markedly influences the climate of the State. One of the greatest contrasts in precipitation found within a short distance in the United States occurs between the western slopes of the Sierras in California and the valleys just to the east of this range. The prevailing winds are from the west. As the warm, moist air from the Pacific Ocean ascends the western slopes of the Sierra Range, the air cools, condenses and most of the moisture falls as precipitation. As the air descends the eastern slope, it is warmed by compression, and very little precipitation occurs. The effects of this mountain barrier are felt not only in the west but throughout the State, with the result that the lowlands of Nevada are largely desert or steppes.</p>\r\n<p>A winter precipitation maximum occurs in the western and south-central portions of the State, a spring maximum in the central and northeastern sections, and a summer maximum primarily in the eastern portion where thunderstorms are most frequent. Precipitation is lightest over the lower parts of the western plateau, a series of long valleys extending from the State border opposite Death Valley in California northward to the Idaho line. In the southern part of those valleys, the average annual precipitation is less than five inches. It increases to 18 inches in Lamoille Canyon on the western side of the Ruby Mountains of northeast Nevada and to about 40 inches in the Sierra Nevada. Variations in precipitation are due mainly to differences in elevation and exposure to precipitation-bearing storms.</p>\r\n<p>The average annual number of days with measurable precipitation varies considerably; Las Vegas averages 29, Reno 54, Winnemucca 71, Ely 77 and Elko 81.</p>\r\n<p>Snowfall is usually heavy in the mountains, particularly in the north. This is conducive to many winter sports activities, including skiing and hunting. Twenty-four hour snowfall can amount to over 45 inches, while seasonal totals of over 330 inches have been recorded.</p>\r\n<p>Mountain snowfall forms the main source of water for stream flow. Meting of the mountain snow pack in the spring usually causes some flooding in northern and western streams during April to June, but damaging floods of this type are infrequent; however, extensive flooding from melting of heavy snow pack has occurred in both the southern and northern parts of the State. Flooding can also be caused by a combination of warm rains and melting snow, especially in the western section. Heavy summer thunderstorms occasionally cause flooding of local streams, but they usually occur in sparsely settled mountainous areas and are seldom destructive. These storms, locally termed cloudbursts, may bring to a locality as much rain in a few hours as would normally fall in several months.</p>\r\n<p>The State has a generous supply of sunshine, the average percentage of possible sunshine being about 65 to 75 at northern and central locations and greater than 80 percent in the south. The low humidity and abundant sunshine produce rapid evaporation. Annual evaporation amounts in the southern portion of the State, as measured in evaporation pans, average over 100 inches. In north and central sections, evaporation amounts average roughly half as much.</p>\r\n<p>Because of the generally arid climate only about six percent of the Stateâs 110,000 square miles of land is under cultivation. Irrigation is maintained in the cultivated areas by impounding the water from melting snow. The Sierra Nevada snow pack provides water for the valleys of Walker, Carson, Truckee and Fallon. Well water is also used to irrigate a large number of acres. In the vicinity of Lovelock, water is impounded in the Rye Patch Reservoir. A small additional area in pastures and wild hay is watered by flooding when snows melt in the spring. A light snowfall in winter and spring creates a shortage of water for irrigation. Long dry spells in summer, which occurs rather frequently, result in injury to ranges and pastures, but have little effect on irrigated crops which depend almost entirely on stored water.</p>\r\n<p>Climate and the Economy- Raising livestock is one of the principal activities of the State. Alfalfa for hay and for seed is by far the most important crop, although small quantities of grains, fruits, vegetables and cotton are also grown.</p>\r\n<p>Mining is the other basic industry in Nevada. The State ranks high in the amount and value of minerals it produces each year, principally manganese, tungsten, mercury, copper, silver, gold, lead and zinc.</p>\r\n<p>Many tourists come to Nevada each year to vacation at Lake Tahoe, the "sky-high" lake that straddles the Nevada-California line in the rugged Sierra, to visit the numerous ghost towns, to fish or boat in the lakes such as Lake Mead, Pyramid Lake and Walker Lake, or to enjoy the cool mountain streams of the State. The spectacular manmade landmark of the Far West, Hoover Dam, is located on the state line between Nevada and Arizona. Las Vegas and Reno are also popular spots with their many hotels, casinos and golf courses.</p>	35.00000	-120.00000	42.00000	-114.00000	0.637
31	New Hampshire	NH	44.0012	-71.6276	7	<p>Topographic Features- New Hampshire occupies 9,304 square miles, nearly one-seventh of New England's total area. From south of 43&deg; North latitude, it extends nearly 200 miles northward to beyond 45&deg; North latitude. At its southern border, New Hampshire extends westward from the Atlantic coastline for almost 100 miles. It narrows to less than 20 miles in width at its northern tip. The eastern border lies near 71&deg; West longitude. Its western border is the Connecticut River, except in the extreme north.</p>\r\n<p>The terrain is hilly to mountainous. Elevations less than 500 feet above sea level are only found in the coastal areas of the southeast, the Merrimack River Valley and the central and southern portions of the Connecticut River valley. Elsewhere the general elevation is from 500 to 1,500 feet, except in the extreme north where elevations reach nearly 2,500 feet. Numerous mountains extend to heights of 2,000 to 4,000 feet above sea level over most of the State except in the southeast. Many White Mountain summits rise above 4,000 feet with eight peaks in the Presidential Range above 5,000 feet. Mt. Washington towers 6,288 feet above sea level. This is the highest mountain in the northeastern United States. The climate atop Mt. Washington makes this location valuable for cold weather testing and research. However, these extreme conditions are not representative of the more temperate climate of the State in general. Some flatland is found near the coast and in the river valleys, with less than 10 percent of the total State area being classified as farmland. The glacier of the great Ice Age accounts for much of the topography, including many of the numerous lakes. About 1,300 lakes and ponds add to the State's attractions. The largest is Lake Winnepesaukee, which covers the area of 71 square miles in the central part of the State. Inland waters cover about 280 square miles. The Atlantic coast is 18 miles in length and has several fine beaches.</p>\r\n<p>The two principal rivers in New Hampshire are the Connecticut and the Merrimack, both flow in a southerly direction. The Connecticut, the larger of the two, rises in the extreme northern part of the State and forms the border with Vermont. Other rivers include the Androscoggin and the Saco which rise in the east slopes of the White Mountains and flow eastward into Maine.</p>\r\n<p>Approximately 80 percent of New Hampshire is forested. Considerable area, especially in the north, is sparsely settled. The mountains, hills, lakes, streams and forests combine to make New Hampshire a state of scenic beauty.</p>\r\n<p>Characteristics of New Hampshire climate are: changeableness in the weather, large ranges in temperature, both daily and annual, great differences between the same seasons in different years, equable distribution of precipitation and considerable diversity from place to place. The regional New England climatic influences are modified in New Hampshire by the varying distances from the relatively mild ocean waters, elevations and types of terrain. These modifying factors divide the State into two climatological divisions, Northern and Southern. A detailed discussion concerning both divisions follows.</p>\r\n<p>New Hampshire lies in the "prevailing westerlies," the belt of generally eastward air movement, which encircles the globe in the middle latitudes. Embedded in this circulation are extensive masses of air originating in higher or lower latitudes and interacting to produce frequent storm systems. Relative to most other sections of the country, a large number of such storms pass over or near to New Hampshire. The majority of air masses affecting the State belong to three types: cold, dry air pouring down from sub-arctic North America; warm, moist air streaming up on a long journey from the Gulf of Mexico, and subtropical waters (Gulf Stream) to the east; and cool, damp air moving in from the North Atlantic. Because the atmospheric flow is usually offshore, New Hampshire is influenced more by the first two types than it is by the third. In other words, the adjacent ocean constitutes an important modifying factor, especially along the immediate coastal plain, but does not dominate the State's climate.</p>\r\n<p>The procession of contrasting air masses and the relatively frequent passage of storm circulations bring about a roughly twice-weekly alternation from mainly fair to cloudy or stormy conditions. These fluctuations are often attended by abrupt changes in temperature, moisture, sunshine, wind direction and speed. There is usually no regular or persistent rhythm to this sequence, and it can be interrupted by intervals during which the weather patterns continue stable for several days or even several weeks on certain occasions. New Hampshire's weather, however, is cited for variety rather than monotony. Changeability is one of the features on a longer time-scale. That is, the same month or season will often exhibit varying characteristics over the years, sometimes in close alternation, sometimes arranged in similar groups for successive years. A "normal" month, season, or year is the exception, rather than the rule.</p>\r\n<p>The basic climate, as outlined above, obviously does not result from the predominance of any single controlling weather regime, but is rather the integrated effect of a variety of weather patterns. Hence, "weather averages" in New Hampshire usually are not sufficient for important planning purposes without further climatological analysis.</p>\r\n<p>The Northern Division contains approximately one-third of the State and includes the northern and west-central areas. Its southern border is roughly parallel to the coast, except where it bends northward near the Connecticut River. This area is affected more by its higher elevation and northerly latitude than by the ocean when compared to the Southern Division. The Southern Division comprises the remaining area. Its lower elevation and latitude tend to cause higher temperatures, though this is modified seasonally by oceanic influence. A strip near the coast could be a third division, but its small size hardly merits delineation.</p>\r\n<p>Temperature- The annual temperature averages 41 degrees Fahrenheit (&deg; F) in the Northern Division and near 45 in the Southern. Within the Northern Division it ranges from about 37 in the extreme north to 42&deg; F in the extreme south. Averages vary within the divisions from causes other than latitude. Elevation, slope and other environmental effects, including urbanization, each has an effect. An extreme effect of altitude is Mt. Washington, whose summit has an annual average of 27&deg; F, compared to averages of 40 to 42 at other stations in the general area. Across the State, the highest temperatures can top 100&deg; F while the lowest can drop lower than -45&deg; F.</p>\r\n<p>Summer temperatures are delightfully comfortable for the most part. They are reasonably uniform across New Hampshire, excepting topographical extremes. Hot days (90&deg; F or higher) occur an average from only a few times per year in the extreme north to five to 15 per year across most of the rest of the State. The frequency varies from place to place and from year to year. They range, in frequency of occurrence, from only a few in a cool summer to as many as 30 to 40 in the Southern Division in the hottest summers. The diurnal range may reach 40 degrees or more during cool, dry weather in valleys and lowlands. Freezing temperatures may be a threat even in the warmer months in a few of the more susceptible areas.</p>\r\n<p>Average temperatures vary from place to place more in the winter than in the summer. Days with subzero readings are relatively few along the immediate coast but are common inland. They range from 25 to 50 in number per year for most of the Northern Division and from 10 to 25 in the Southern Division.</p>\r\n<p>The growing season for vegetation subject to injury from freezing temperatures averages from 95 to 125 days in the Northern Division. In the Southern Division the average is 120 to 140 days except up to 160 to 180 in the extreme southeast, a coastal effect. Local topography causes exceptions to these values. Swampy areas, particularly, may have a shorter season. The average date of the last freezing temperature in spring varies from late April at some of the southern stations to early June in colder locations across the north. For most of the State, the growing season begins in May and ends in the latter part of September.</p>\r\n<p>Precipitation- New Hampshire is fortunate in having its precipitation rather evenly distributed throughout the year. Low pressure, or frontal, storm systems are the principal year-round moisture producers. This activity ebbs somewhat in the summer, but thunderstorms are of increased activity at this time, tending to make up the difference. Though brief and often of small extent, the thunderstorms produce the heaviest local rainfall intensities, and sometimes cause minor washouts of roads and soil erosion. Rains of one to two inches in an hour can be expected at least once in a 10-year period.</p>\r\n<p>Variations in monthly precipitation totals are extreme, ranging from no measurable amount to 10 inches or more. A majority of the monthly totals falls in the range of 50 to 200 percent of normal. As prolonged droughts are fairly infrequent, irrigation water is available during the fairly common dry spells of summer. Similarly, widespread floods are infrequent. However, tropical systems and their remnants can sometimes cause significant flooding. Floods occur most often in the spring when they are caused by a combination of rain and melting snow. At other times of the year, high flows and major flooding from rainfall alone occur less frequently. The mean annual runoff in the streams ranges from 14 inches in the north-central Connecticut River Valley to 50 inches in the White Mountains area.</p>\r\n<p>Total annual precipitation averages near 42 inches in the Northern Division and 44 inches in the Southern. The distribution is quite uniform across the Southern Division, ranging from 37 to 46 inches. The mountainous character of much of the northern and central New Hampshire, and the generally higher elevations there, account variability from place to place. As an extreme example, Berlin, elevation 930 feet, has an annual average of 40 inches, about 39 percent that of Mt. Washington (102 inches), where the gauge elevation is about 6,262 feet above sea level. These stations are only about 18 miles apart.</p>\r\n<p>Considerable rain and/or wet snow falls along the coast in the winter, while farther inland snow is more generally the rule. Occasionally freezing rain occurs, coating exposed surfaces with troublesome ice. Most areas can expect at least one glaze episode annually.</p>\r\n<p>Measurable precipitation falls on an average of one day in three. Frequency is higher at the higher elevations and in extreme northern New Hampshire, up to 140 to 150 days annually. At the Mt. Washington station, measurable precipitation falls on average 214 days per year. As much as six inches of rain in 24 hours is rare in the State. However, the town of Warren, located in the west central part of the State, recorded 6.31 inches in six hours. New Durham had 8.00 inches in 24 hours. The heaviest, 24 hour event in New Hampshire was Mt. Washington's 10.38 inches on February 10 - 11, 1970.</p>\r\n<p>Average annual snowfall amounts in the Southern Division increase from around 50 inches near the coast to 60 to 70 inches inland. Totals vary greatly in the Northern Division. Along the Connecticut River in the southern portion, totals average near 60 inches, but increase to over 100 inches at the higher elevations of the northern and western portions. The summit of Mt. Washington receives over 300 inches. As an example of great variation over a short distance, Berlin only 18 miles to the north, receives about 80 inches annually.</p>\r\n<p>The number of days with one inch or more of snowfall varies from near 20 per season over much of the Southern Division up to 30 to 40 in the Northern Division and 50 or more at the highest elevations. Most years will have several snowstorms depositing five or more inches. Storms of this magnitude disrupt transportation temporarily.</p>\r\n<p>On November 22 - 23, 1943, a single storm dropped 56 inches of snow at Randolph and over 50 inches at other nearby stations. However, snowstorms of as much as 20 inches or more are unusual in any part of the State. Heaviest 24-hour falls of records at some stations do not exceed 20 inches.</p>\r\n<p>Snowfall is highly variable from year to year or for the same month in different years, as well as from place to place. Totals for the least snowy seasons range from one-fourth to one-half that of the greatest seasonal amounts. At Mt. Washington, for example, seasonal snowfall range from a minimum of 135 inches to a maximum of 394 inches. At Concord, totals ranged from 29 to 103 inches. Month to month variations are much greater. A few Februarys have had less than one inch of snowfall at Concord while the maximum monthly February total is 49.8 inches.</p>\r\n<p>Snow cover is continuous through the whole winter season as a rule. Most frequent exceptions are found along the immediate coast and sometimes in southern portions of the State. Snow cover reaches its maximum depth, on average, during the latter half of February in the Southern Division. In the Northern Division, the greatest depth comes in early March, excepting the higher elevations where the date is deferred to the middle of March. Some stations have a tendency for a secondary maximum in December or January. Water stored in the snow makes an important contribution to a continuous water supply. The spring melting is usually too gradual to produce serious flooding.</p>\r\n<p>Sunshine averages over 50 percent of the possible amount in the Southern Division. The percentage is near 50 in the lower elevations of the northern Division. Higher elevations and the peaks are cloudier, especially in winter, reducing the percentage to less than 50, generally. Mt. Washington reports an average just over 30 percent.</p>\r\n<p>Heavy fog occurrence varies widely with location and topography. Persistent fogs are sometimes experienced along the coast and on the higher elevations inland. Duration of fogs diminishes inland over flat and valley locations, however, the shorter duration heavy ground fogs of early morning frequently occur at susceptible places in these areas. The number of fog days varies from a low of 20 to well over 100 for the highest peaks.</p>\r\n<p>The prevailing wind, based on a yearly average, comes from a westerly direction. It is predominantly from the northwest in winter and from the southwest in summer. Topography has a strong influence on prevailing direction. Points in major river valleys, for example, may have prevailing directions paralleling the valley. Along the coast in the spring and summer, the sea breeze is important. These onshore winds, from the cool ocean, may come inland for 10 miles or so; infrequently, they may reach as far inland as 30 miles into the interior. They tend to retard spring growth, but are refreshingly cool in the summer.</p>\r\n<p>The State averages two tornadoes per year. Perhaps the worst tornado experienced in New England was the 1821 Sunapee tornado. Fortunately, most tornadoes are very small, affect a localized area. Tornadoes can occur in the northern portion of the State as well. One such occurrence was at Berlin in 1929. About 80 percent of the State's tornadoes occur between May 15 and September 15. Three-quarters strike between 2:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. The peak months are June and July and the peak hour of occurrence 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. The chance of a tornado striking any given spot is extremely small.</p>\r\n<p>Thunder and hailstorms have a similar frequency maximum from mid-spring to early fall. Thunderstorms occur on 15 to 30 days a year. The most severe are attended by hail. Hailstorms can severely damage or even ruin field crops, break glass, dent vehicles and damage other vulnerable, exposed objects. However, this danger is minimized because of the size of the area struck is usually small.</p>\r\n<p>Ice storms can produce perilous travel. A few widespread and prolonged ice storms have occurred. Besides affecting travel and transport, the weight of the ice breaks limbs and trees, utility lines and poles. In designing structures such as steel towers, potential ice load should be considered. The ice load also magnifies the wind stress by increasing the area exposed to the wind.</p>\r\n<p>Climate and the Economy- Activities in New Hampshire are profoundly influenced by the climate. Tree growth is especially favored. Covering approximately four-fifths of the area, forests constitute a major scenic attraction. The spectacular coloration of foliage in the autumn is of special interest, drawing numerous visitors. Forests also provide material for forest product industries. These include lumbering, paper-making, wood products manufacturing, and related industries. The ample supply of rainfall provides not only for the growth of trees but also the huge amounts of water required in the making of paper and paper products. Electricity is generated from hydroelectric sources.</p>\r\n<p>Climate is a significant factor in the State's agriculture. It favors the production of high-value, specialized crops. New Hampshire, therefore, ranks well in the Nation in cash receipts per acre from farm marketing. Poultry raising, apples production, truck farming and dairying are all important to the State's economy. Top quality maple syrup is produced in commercial quantity. Considerable acreage is devoted to pasture, hay, oats, and in the southern portion, corn. Potatoes are also grown. The most fertile soils are found in the river valleys, such as those of the Connecticut and Merrimack rivers.</p>\r\n<p>To the tourism and vacation trade, New Hampshire's climate is very important. In the summer and fall, pleasant temperatures prevail at coastal and lake resorts. Skiing and related winter sports are made possible by the abundant snowfall. For hunters and anglers, the State's abundant resources provide an opportunity to try their luck and skill.</p>\r\n<p>In summary, the climate of New Hampshire contributes greatly to its industrial, agricultural and vacation activities. The climate is a rich, natural asset and is favorable to further economic development.</p>	42.66667	-72.61667	45.30000	-70.61667	0.534

33	New Mexico	NM	34.1661	-106.0261	6	<p>Topographic Features- New Mexico, fifth largest state in the Union with a total area of 121,666 square miles, is approximately 350 square miles and lies mostly between latitudes 32 and 37&deg; North and longitudes 103 and 109&deg; West. The State's topography consists mainly of high plateaus of mesas, with numerous mountain ranges, canyons, valleys and normally dry arroyos. Average elevation is about 4,700 feet above sea level. The lowest point is just above the Red Bluff Reservoir at 2,817 feet where the Pecos River flows into Texas. The highest point is Wheeler Peak at 13,161 feet. The principal sources of moisture for the scant rains and snows that fall on the State are the Pacific Ocean, 500 miles to the west and the Gulf of Mexico, 500 miles to the southeast. New Mexico has a mild, arid or semiarid, continental climate characterized by light precipitation totals, abundant sunshine, low relative humidity, and a relatively large annual and diurnal temperature range. The highest mountains have climate characteristics common of the high Rocky Mountains.</p>\r\n<p>The State is divided into three major areas by mountain ranges and highlands, oriented in a general north-south direction, which merge in the north. The Northern Mountains and Central Mountains are between longitude 105 and 106&deg; West. They are the western boundary of the Northeastern and Southeastern Plains which slope gradually eastward and southeastward. The northern part of these eastern plains lies within the Arkansas River Basin and is drained mostly by the Canadian River, which flows southward then eastward into Oklahoma to its confluence with the Arkansas, and the Cimarron River in the extreme northeastern corner. The Pecos River rises in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and flows southward through the Southeastern Plains into Texas, and then southeastward to join the Rio Grande. West of the mountain ranges that forms the Continental Divide, whose height decreases to a markedly lower elevation in southern New Mexico, rivers drain into the Gulf of California through the Colorado River system. Principal tributaries flowing westward into Colorado River are the San Juan River in the north, the Gila River in the south, and the San Francisco tributary of the Gila and other headwater streams of the Little Colorado River in the west-central area. The largest closed basins in the west are the Plains of St. Augustine in Catron County and the Rio Mimbres Basin in Grant and Luna Counties. Between the Northern Mountains and the Central Highland system and the Continental Divide system is the Rio Grand Valley which widens toward the south. The Rio Grande rises in the San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado, flows southward through New Mexico, then southeastward along the Texas-Mexico border into the Gulf of Mexico. The closed Tularosa Basin in southern New Mexico is in an intermountain area east of the Central valley.</p>\r\n<p>Temperature- Mean annual temperatures range from 64 degrees Fahrenheit (&deg; F) in the extreme southeast to less than 40 in the high mountains and valleys of the north; elevation is a greater factor in determining the temperature of any specific location than its latitude. This is shown by only a three degree difference in mean temperature between stations at similar elevations, one in the extreme northeast and the other in the extreme southwest; however at two stations only 15 miles apart, but differing in elevation by 4,700 feet, the mean annual temperatures are 61 and 45&deg; F-a difference of 16 degrees or a little more than three degrees decrease in temperature for each 1,000 foot increase in elevation.</p>\r\n<p>During the summer months, individual daytime temperatures quite often exceed 100&deg; F at elevations below 5,000 feet; but the average monthly maximum temperatures during July, the warmest month, range from slightly above 90&deg;F at lower elevations to the upper 70s at high elevations. Warmest days quite often occur in June. The highest temperature of record in New Mexico is 122&deg; F set at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (Eddy County) on June 27, 1994. A preponderance of clear skies and low relative humidity permit rapid cooling by radiation from the earth after sundown; consequently nights are usually comfortable in summer. The average range between daily high and low temperatures is from 25 to 35 degrees.</p>\r\n<p>In January, the coldest month, average daytime temperatures range from the middle 50s in the southern and central valleys to the middle 30s in the higher elevations of the north. Minimum temperatures below freezing are common in all sections of the State during the winter, but subzero Fahrenheit temperatures are rare except in the mountains. The lowest temperature recorded at regular observing stations in the State was -50&deg; F at Gavilan (Rio Arriba County) on February 1, 1951.</p>\r\n<p>The freeze-free season ranges from more than 200 days in the southern valleys to less than 80 days in the northern mountains where some high mountain valleys have freezes in summer months.</p>\r\n<p>Precipitation- Average annual precipitation ranges from less than 10 inches over much of the southern desert and the Rio Grande and San Juan valleys to more than 20 inches at the higher elevations in the State. A wide variation in annual totals is characteristic of arid and semiarid climates as illustrated by annual extremes of 2.95 inches and 33.94 inches at Carlsbad during a period of more than 71 years.</p>\r\n<p>Summer rains fall almost entirely during brief, but frequently intense thunderstorms. The general southeasterly circulation from the Gulf of Mexico brings moisture for these storms into the State, and strong surface heating combined with orographic lifting as the air moves over higher terrain causes air currents and condensation. July and August are the rainiest months over most of the State with from 30 to 40 percent of the year's total moisture falling during these months. The San Juan valley area is least affected by this summer circulation, receiving about 25 percent of its annual rainfall during July and August. During the warmest six months of the year, May through October, total precipitation averages 60 percent of the annual total in the eastern plains.</p>\r\n<p>Winter precipitation is caused mainly by frontal activity associated with the general movement of Pacific Ocean storms across the country from west to east. As these storms move inland, much of the moisture is precipitated over the coastal and inland mountain ranges of California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah. Much of the remaining moisture falls on the western slope of the Continental Divide. This dryness is most noticeable in the Central Valley and on eastern slopes of the mountains.</p>\r\n<p>Much of winter's precipitation falls as snow in the mountain areas, but rain or snow may occur in the valleys. Average annual snowfall ranges from about three inches at southern desert and southeastern plains sites to well over 100 inches at northern mountain stations. It may exceed 300 inches in the highest mountains of the north.</p>\r\n<p>General floods are seldom widespread in New Mexico. Heavy thunderstorms may bring several inches of rain to small areas in a short time. Because of the rough terrain and sparse vegetation in many areas, runoff from these storms frequently causes local flash floods. Normally dry arroyos may overflow their banks for several hours, halting traffic where water crosses highways; damaging bridges, culverts and roadways; and if in an urban area, possibly causing considerable property damage. Snowmelt during April to June, especially in combination with a warm rain, and heavy general rains during August to October may occasionally cause flooding of the larger rivers. Although streams in New Mexico have risen substantially during several floods, the overflows cannot be termed disastrous because comparatively little real property damage has resulted in this lightly industrialized and sparsely populated State. During spring snowmelt, main rivers may exceed flood stage and cause damage to property along their banks.</p>\r\n<p>On rare occasions, tropical system remnants will dump rains on New Mexico as it moves through or close to the State. Wind is of little concern from these remnants. These systems came ashore at either the Gulf of Mexico or the Gulf of California.</p>\r\n<p>Tornadoes are occasionally reported in New Mexico, most frequently during the afternoon and early evening hours from May through August. There is an average of nine tornadoes a year, but damage has been light because most occur over open, sparsely populated country. The tornadoes causing the most loss of life and injuries occurred in 1930 at Wagon Mound with three deaths and 19 injuries.</p>\r\n<p>New Mexico has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with 75 to 80 percent of the possible sunshine being received. In winter, this is particularly noticeable with from 70 to 75 percent of the possible sunshine being received. The sunshine combined with relatively low humidity often makes for very comfortable weather.</p>\r\n<p>Climate and the Economy- The principal industries of New Mexico are agriculture, mining, lumbering, recreation and gas and oil production. Of these, the influence of climate upon agriculture and recreation is of major importance. Less than four percent of the State's area is under cultivation, and about one-third of this area is irrigated. Farming on this latter portion is intensive. More than one-half of the area of the State is pastureland, about 28 percent is woodland. The remainder is generally classified as wasteland and urban. Most irrigated land is in the southern valleys, although some is found in the middle of the Rio Grande Valley, the Canadian Valley in the northeast, the San Juan Valley in the northwest, and in east-central counties. These irrigated lands draw on stored surface water as well as underground water supplies for irrigation. Most dryland farming is in the eastern plains, but short-season dryland summer crops are grown in some small areas in the Central Highlands. All of the crops of New Mexico depend on water from snowmelt to meet their needs for crop growth.</p>	31.33333	-109.00000	37.00000	-103.00000	0.845
34	New York	NY	42.7873	-75.7947	6	<p>Topographic Features- New York State contains 49,576 square miles, inclusive of 1,637 square miles of inland water, but exclusive of the boundary-water areas of Long Island Sound, New York Harbor and lakes Ontario and Erie. The major portion of the State lies generally between latitudes 42 and 45&deg; North and between longitudes 73.5 and 79.75&deg; West. However, in the extreme southeast, a triangular portion extends southward to about latitude 40.5&deg; North, while Long Island lies eastward to about 72&deg; West longitude.</p>\r\n<p>The principal highland regions of the State are the Adirondacks in the northeast and the Appalachian Plateau (Southern Plateau) in the south. The Appalachian Plateau is subdivided by the deep channel of Seneca Lake, which extends from the lake plain of Lake Ontario southward to the Chemung River valley, into the Western and Eastern Plateaus. The Western Plateau extends from the eastern Finger Lakes across the hills of southwestern New York to the narrow lake plain bordering Lake Erie, while the Eastern Plateau extends from the eastern Finger Lakes to the Hudson River Valley and includes the Catskill Mountains.</p>\r\n<p>A minor highland region occurs in southeastern New York where the Hudson River has cut a valley between the Palisades on the west, near the New Jersey border, and the Taconic Mountains on the east, along the Connecticut and Massachusetts border. Just west of the Adirondacks and the upper Black River valley in Lewis County is another minor highland known as Tug Hill.</p>\r\n<p>Much of the eastern border of the State consists of a long, narrow lowland region, which is occupied by lakes Champlain and George, and the middle and lower portions of the Hudson Valley. Another lowland region, the Great Lakes Plain, on the northern and western boundaries of the State adjoins lakes Erie and Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. This region is widest south of the eastern end of Lake Ontario, but does narrow to a width of less than five miles in the western portion of the State. A third lowland region, which contains Lake Oneida and a deep valley cut by the Mohawk River, connects the Hudson Valley and the Great Lakes Plain. Long Island, which is a part of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, comprises the fourth lowland region of the State.</p>\r\n<p>Approximately 40 percent of New York State has an elevation of more than 1,000 feet above sea level. In northwestern Essex County, confined to an area of 500 to 600 square miles, are a number of peaks with an elevation of between 4,000 to 5,000 feet. The highest point, Mount Marcy, reaches a height of 5,344 feet above sea level. Nearby Mount MacIntyre ranges to a height of 5,112 feet.</p>\r\n<p>The Appalachian Plateau merges variously into the Great Lakes Plain of western New York with gradual-to steep-sloping terrain. The valleys of the Finger Lakes, which resemble the appearance of outstretched fingers on the hand, extend southward from the Great Lakes Plain.</p>\r\n<p>The major Finger Lakes going from west to east are Canandaigua, Keuka, Seneca, Cayuga and Skaneateles. Other prominent lakes in the State include Lake George in the central part of the eastern boundary, Lake Oneida in the central New York between Syracuse and Rome and Chautauqua Lake in the extreme southwest. Sacandaga and Pepacton Reservoirs are sizeable manmade bodies of water in the eastern portion of the State. Innumerable smaller lakes and ponds dot the landscape, with more than 1,500 in the Adirondack region alone.</p>\r\n<p>Rivers of New York State may be divided into those that are tributary to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River and those that flow in a general southward direction. The first group includes rivers such as the: Genesee, Oswego, Black, Oswegatchie, Grass, Raquette, Saranac and Ausable. The Chemung, Susquehanna, Delaware and Hudson river systems, which are part of the Atlantic slope drainage and the Allegheny River, which is part of the Ohio Basin drainage, comprise the second group.</p>\r\n<p>The climate of New York State is broadly representative of the humid continental type, which prevails in the northeastern United States, but its diversity is not usually encountered within an area of comparable size. The geographical position of the State and the usual course of air masses, governed by the large-scale patterns of atmospheric circulation, provide general climatic controls. Differences in latitude, character of the topography and proximity to large bodies of water have pronounced effects on the climate.</p>\r\n<p>The planetary atmospheric circulation brings a great variety of air masses to New York State. Masses of cold, dry air frequently arrive from the northern interior of the continent. Prevailing south and southwesterly winds transport warm, humid air, which has been conditioned by the Gulf of Mexico and adjacent subtropical waters. These two air masses provide the dominant continental characteristics of the climate. The third great air mass flows inland from the North Atlantic Ocean and produces cool, cloudy and damp weather conditions. This maritime influence is important to New York's climatic regime, especially in the southeastern portion of the State, but it is secondary to that of the more prevalent air mass flow from the continent.</p>\r\n<p>Nearly all storm and frontal systems moving eastward across the continent, pass through or in close proximity to New York State. Storm systems often move northward along the Atlantic coast and have an important influence on the weather and climate of Long Island and the lower Hudson Valley. Frequently, areas deep in the interior of the State feel the effects of such coastal storms.</p>\r\n<p>Lengthy periods of either abnormally cold or warm weather result from the movement of great high pressure (anticyclonic) systems into and through the eastern United States. Cold temperatures prevail over New York whenever Arctic air masses, under high barometric pressure, flow southward from central Canada or from Hudson Bay. High-pressure systems often move just off the Atlantic coast, become more or less stagnant for several days, and then a persistent airflow from the southwest or south affects the State. This circulation brings the very warm, often humid weather of the summer season and the mild, more pleasant temperatures during the fall, winter and spring seasons.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Temperature- Many atmospheric and physiographic controls on the climate result in a considerable variation of temperature conditions over New York State. The average annual mean temperature ranges from about 40 degrees Fahrenheit (&deg; F) in the Adirondacks to near 55 in the New York City area. In January, the average mean temperature is approximately 16 in the Adirondacks and St. Lawrence Valley, but increases to about 26 along Lake Erie and in the lower Hudson Valley and to 31&deg; F on Long Island. The highest temperature of record in New York State is 108&deg; F at Troy on July 22, 1926. Temperatures of 107&deg; F have been observed at Lewiston, Elmira, Poughkeepsie and New York City. The record coldest temperature is -52&deg; F at Stillwater Reservoir (northern Herkimer County) on February 9, 1934 and also at Old Forge (also northern Herkimer County) on February 18, 1979. Some 30 communities have recorded temperatures of -40 or colder, most of them occurring in the northern one-half of the State and the remainder in the Western Plateau Division and in localities just south of the Mohawk Valley.</p>\r\n<p>The winters are long and cold in the Plateau Divisions of the State. In the majority of winter seasons, a temperature of -25&deg; F or lower can be expected in the northern highlands (Northern Plateau) and -15 or colder in the southwestern and east-central highlands (Southern Plateau). The Adirondack region records from 35 to 45 days with below subzero temperatures in normal to severe winters, with a somewhat fewer number of such days occurring near Lake Champlain and the St. Lawrence River. In the Southern Plateau and in the upper Hudson Valley divisions, subzero minima are observed on about 15 days most winters and on more than 25 days in notably cold ones.</p>\r\n<p>Winter temperatures are moderated considerably in the Great Lakes Plain of western New York. The moderating influence of lakes Erie and Ontario is comparable to that produced by the Atlantic Ocean in the southern portion of the Hudson Valley. In both regions, the coldest temperature in most winters will range between 0 and -10&deg; F. Long Island and New York City experience below subzero minima in two or three winters out of 10, with the low temperature generally near -5&deg; F.</p>\r\n<p>The summer climate is cool in the Adirondacks, Catskills and higher elevations of the Southern Plateau. The New York City area and lower portions of the Hudson Valley have rather warm summers by comparison, with some periods of high, uncomfortable humidity. The remainder of New York State enjoys pleasantly warm summers with occasional, brief intervals of sultry conditions. Summer daytime temperatures usually range from the upper 70s to mid 80s over much of the State, producing an atmospheric environment favorable to many athletic and recreational outdoor activities.</p>\r\n<p>Temperatures of 90&deg; F or higher occur from late May to mid-September in all but the normally cooler portions of the State. The New York City area and most of the Hudson Valley record an average of from 18 to 25 days with such temperatures during the warm season, but in the Northern and Southern Plateaus the normal amount does not exceed two or three days. While temperatures of 100&deg; F are rare, many long-term weather stations, especially in the southern one-half of the State, have recorded maxima in the 100 to 105&deg; F range on one or more occasions. Minimum temperatures drop to the 40s and upper 30s with some frequency during the summer season in the interior portions of the Plateau Divisions. It is not uncommon for temperatures to approach the freezing point in the Adirondacks and Southern Plateau during June and the latter half of August, but rarely in July.</p>\r\n<p>The moderating effect of lakes Erie and Ontario on temperatures assumes practical importance during the spring and fall seasons. The lake waters warm slowly in the spring, the effect of which is to reduce the warming of the atmosphere over adjacent land areas. Plant growth is thereby retarded, allowing a great variety of freeze-sensitive crops, especially tree and vine fruits, to reach critical early stages of development when the risk of freeze injury is minimized or greatly reduced. In the fall season, the lake waters cool more slowly than the land areas and thus serve as a heat source. The cooling of the atmosphere at night is moderated or reduced, the occurrence of freezing temperatures is delayed, and the growing season is lengthened for freeze-sensitive crops and vegetables.</p>\r\n<p>The average length of the freeze-free season in New York State varies from 100 to 120 days in the Adirondacks, Catskills and higher elevations of the Western Plateau Division to 180 to 200 days on Long Island. The important fruit and truck crop areas in the Great Lakes Plain enjoy a frost-free growing season of from 150 to 180 days in duration. A freeze-free season of similar length also prevails in the Hudson Valley from Albany southward to Westchester and Orange counties, another zone of valuable crop production. The Southern Plateau, St. Lawrence Valley and Lake Champlain regions have an average duration of 120 to 150 days between the last spring and first fall freezes.</p>\r\n<p>Precipitation- Moisture for precipitation in New York State is transported primarily from the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean through circulation patterns and storm systems of the atmosphere. Distribution of precipitation within the state is greatly influenced by topography and proximity to the Great Lakes or Atlantic Ocean. Average annual amounts in excess of 50 inches occur in the western Adirondacks, Tug Hill area and the Catskills, while slightly less than that amount is noted in the higher elevations of the Western Plateau southeast of Lake Erie. Areas of least rainfall, with an average of about 30 to 33 inches, occur near Lake Ontario in the extreme western counties, in the lower half of the Genesee River Valley, and in the vicinity of Lake Champlain.</p>\r\n<p>New York State has a fairly uniform distribution of precipitation during the year. There are no distinctly dry or wet seasons, which are regularly repeated on an annual basis. Minimum precipitation occurs in the winter season, with an average monthly accumulation ranging from about 3.5 inches on Long Island to 2.2 inches in the Finger Lakes and Lake Champlain regions. Maximum amounts are noted in the summer season throughout the State except along the Great Lakes where slight peaks of similar magnitude occur in both the spring and fall seasons. Average monthly amounts in the summer vary from three inches in the lowlands south of Lake Ontario (Great Lakes Division) to four inches in the Eastern Plateau, Hudson Valley and Coastal Divisions. New York's precipitation tends to be distributed most uniformly over the year in counties along the coast and the Great Lakes.</p>\r\n<p>Variations in precipitation amounts from month to month or for the same month in different years can be wide for any individual area. Usually such variations range from near an inch to about six inches; in extreme cases, the variation is from less than an inch to 10 inches or more.</p>\r\n<p>Almost any calendar month has the potential of having the lightest, or heaviest, monthly accumulation of precipitation within a calendar year at a given location. The greatest monthly precipitation of record in New York State was a total of 25.27 inches at West Shokan (Ulster County) in October 1955. On the other hand, wide areas of the State measured less than 0.3 inch of rain in October 1963. Within relatively short distances, precipitation in the same month may be strikingly different. An extreme example occurred in August 1971 with a total of 16.7 inches falling at New York city's Borough of Richmond (Staten Island), but only 2.9 inches at Riverhead, about 90 miles away in eastern Long Island.</p>\r\n<p>The amount and distribution of precipitation are normally sufficient for the maintenance of the State's water resources for municipal and industrial supplies, transportation and recreation. Rainfall is usually adequate during the growing season for economic crops, lawns, gardens, shrubs, forests and woodlands. Severe droughts are rare, but deficiencies of precipitation may occur from time to time, which cause at least temporary concern over declining water supplies and moisture stress in crops and other vegetation. In some years, a pronounced shortage of precipitation during the spring or fall months results in a considerable fire hazard in the State's woodlands.</p>\r\n<p>The climate of New York State is marked by abundant snowfall. With the exception of the Coastal Division, the State receives an average seasonal amount of 40 inches or more. The average snowfall is greater than 70 inches over some 60 percent of New York's area. The moderating influence of the Atlantic Ocean reduces the snow accumulation to 25 to 35 inches in the New York City area and on Long Island. About one-third of the winter season precipitation in the Coastal Division occurs from storms, which also yield at least an inch of snow. The great bulk of the winter precipitation in upstate New York comes as snow.</p>\r\n<p>Topography, elevation and proximity to large bodies of water result in a great variation of snowfall in the State's interior, even within relatively short distances. Maximum seasonal snowfall, averaging more than 175 inches, occurs on the western and southwestern slopes of the Adirondacks and Tug Hill. A secondary maximum of 150 to 180 inches prevails in the southwestern highlands, some 10 to 30 miles inland from Lake Erie. Three separate areas of the Eastern Plateau record heavy snow accumulations, averaging from 100 to 120 inches: (1) the uplands of southwestern Onondaga County and adjoining counties; (2) the Cherry Valley section of northern Otsego and southern Herkimer counties; and (3) the Catskill highlands in Ulster, Delaware and Sullivan counties. Minimum seasonal snowfall of 40 to 50 inches occurs upstate in (1) Niagara County, near the south shore of Lake Ontario, (2) the Chemung and mid-Genesee River valleys of western New York, and (3) near the Hudson River in Orange, Rockland and Westchester counties upstream to the southern portion of Albany County.</p>\r\n<p>In northern New York, the Adirondack region has an average seasonal snowfall in excess of 90 inches, but amounts decrease to 60 to 70 inches in the lowlands of the St. Lawrence Valley and to about 60 inches in the vicinity of Lake Champlain.</p>\r\n<p>Snow produced in the lee of lakes Erie and Ontario is a prominent and very important aspect of New York's climate. As cold air crosses the unfrozen lake waters, it is warmed in the lower layers, picks up moisture and reaches the land in an unstable condition. Precipitation in the form - 5 -</p>\r\n<p>of snow is released as the airstreams moves inland an over the gradually sloping higher terrain. Heavy snow squalls frequently occur, generating from a foot to two feet of snow and occasionally four feet or more. Snowfall produced by this "lake-effect" usually extends into the Mohawk Valley and often inland as far as the southern Finger Lakes and nearby southern tier of counties. Counties to the lee of Lake Erie are subject to heavy lake-effect snows in November and December, but as the lake surface gradually freezes by midwinter, these snows become less frequent. Areas near Lake Ontario, especially those to the southeast and east, are exposed to severe snow squalls well into February because the Lake generally retains considerable open water throughout the winter months.</p>\r\n<p>In the heavy snow belts near lakes Erie and Ontario as well as in the plateau regions of eastern and northern New York, monthly snowfall amounts in excess of 24 inches are experienced in most winters; accumulations of more than 50 inches within two consecutive months are not uncommon. Monthly accumulations of between three and 10 inches usually occur in New York City and Long Island during the winter season, but occasionally the amounts may exceed 20 inches as a result of recurring coastal storms (âNorâeastersâ).</p>\r\n<p>A durable snow cover generally begins to develop in the Adirondacks and northern lowlands by late November and remains on the ground until various times in April, depending upon late winter snowfall and early spring temperatures. The Southern Plateau, Great Lakes Plain in southern portions of western upstate New York and the Hudson Valley experience a continuous snow cover from about mid-December to mid-March, with maximum depths usually occurring in February. Bare ground may occur briefly in the lower elevations of these regions during some winters. From late December or early January through February, the Atlantic coastal region of the State experiences alternating periods of measurable snow cover and bare ground.</p>\r\n<p>Although major floods are relatively infrequent, appreciable damage usually occurs every year in one or more localities of New York State. Floods that arise from a variety of causes have been recorded in all seasons. The greatest potential and frequency for floods occur in the early spring when substantial rains combine with rapid snow melting to produce a heavy runoff. Several historic floods from this cause have occurred in the major river basins of New York. However, in northern New York, the normally colder early spring temperatures are conducive to a slower rate of snowmelt. In combination with other factors, major spring floods have been less frequent along streams draining into the St. Lawrence River. Ice jams sometimes contribute to serious flooding in localized areas.</p>\r\n<p>Damaging floods are caused at other times of the year by prolonged periods of heavy rainfall. In combination with heavy showers and thundershowers, the rugged terrain of the Adirondacks and Southern Plateau is conducive to occasional severe flash floods on smaller streams. Metropolitan New York City and other heavily urbanized areas of the State are subject to severe flooding of highways, streets and low-lying ground. Replacement of the natural soil cover with cement, asphalt and other impervious materials encourages such floods from rains of not more than moderately heavy intensity.</p>\r\n<p>The shores of Long Island, especially those facing the Atlantic Ocean, are subject to tidal flooding during storm surges. Winds generated by hurricanes and great coastal storms may drive tidal waters well inland, causing extensive property damage and beach erosion.</p>\r\n<p>The prevailing wind is generally from the west in New York State. A southwest component becomes evident in winds during the warmer months while a northwest component is characteristic of the colder half of the year. Occasionally, well-developed storm systems moving across the continent or along the Atlantic coast are accompanied by very strong winds, which cause considerable property damage over wide areas of the State. A unique effect of strong cyclonic winds from the southwest is the rise of water to abnormally high levels at the northeastern end of Lake Erie.</p>\r\n<p>Thunderstorms occur on an average of about 30 days in a year throughout the State. Destructive winds and lightning strikes in local areas are common with the more vigorous warm-season thunderstorms. Locally, hail occurs with more severe thunderstorms, but extensive, crippling losses to property and crops are rare.</p>\r\n<p>Tornadoes are not common. About six of these storms strike limited, localized areas of New York State in most years. The paths of destruction are usually short and narrow. Tornadoes occur generally between late May and late August.</p>\r\n<p>Storms of freezing rain occur on one or more occasions during the winter season and often affect a wide area of the State in any one incident. While such storms are usually limited to a thin but dangerous coating of ice on highways, sidewalks and exposed surfaces, crippling destruction of utility lines, transmission towers and trees over an extensive portion of the State may result on rare occasions.</p>\r\n<p>Tropical cyclones periodically cause serious and heavy losses in the vicinity of Long Island and southeastern upstate New York.</p>\r\n<p>The greatest storm hazard in terms of area and number of people affected is heavy snow. Norâeaster storms occur with some frequency in most winters. Snow yields of from 12 to 24 inches or more from such storms have fallen over the southeastern one-quarter of the State, including Long Island, and will often extend into western and northern interior New York. Snow squalls along the Great Lakes have been previously cited. These may persist over a period of a week or more, bringing snow amounts in excess of 40 inches to local areas that lie to the eastern lee of lakes Erie and Ontario. During a heavy snow squall, surface visibility is reduced to zero. Blizzard conditions of heavy snow, high winds and rapidly falling temperature occur occasionally, but are much less characteristics of New York's climate than in the plains of Midwestern United States.</p>\r\n<p>The climate of the State features much cloudy weather during the months of November, December and January in upstate New York, especially those regions that adjoin the Great Lakes and Finger Lakes and include the southern tier of counties. From June through September, however, about 60 to 70 percent of the possible sunshine hours are received. In the Atlantic coastal region, the sunshine hours increases from 50 percent of possible in the winter to about 65 percent of possible in the summer.</p>\r\n<p>The Atlantic Coastal Plain and lower Hudson Valley experience conditions of high temperature and high humidity with some frequency and duration during the summer. By comparison, such conditions occur less frequently in the broad interior of New York State where they are usually shortened by the arrival of cooler, drier air masses from the northwest.</p>\r\n<p>The occurrence of heavy dense fog is variable over the State. The valleys and ridges of the Southern Plateau are most subject to periods of fog, with occurrences averaging about 50 days in a year. In the Great Lakes Plain and northern valleys, the frequency decreases to only 10 to 20 days annually. In those portions of the State with greater maritime influence on the climate, the frequency of dense fog in a year ranges from about 35 days on the south shore of Long Island to 25 days in the Hudson Valley.</p>\r\n<p>Climate and the Economy- New York State's diversified economy, involving agriculture, industry, commerce and recreation, is greatly influenced by the climate.</p>\r\n<p>The general climate as well as regional variations in climate throughout New York State support diversified agriculture. Dairying is a widespread enterprise. Precipitation and temperature conditions favor the growth of alfalfa and grasses for hay and of corn for silage throughout New York, except where limitations are imposed by soils and topography. Corn for grain is produced in the Great Lakes Plain, Southern Plateau and Hudson Valley. The amount and distribution of rainfall, warm (rather than hot) daytime temperatures and frequent cool nights in western and central New York are important environmental factors that aid in the growing of small grains. Dry beans, snap beans and sugar beets are additional valuable crops, which thrive well in New York's climate.</p>\r\n<p>A nationally important production area of apples and other tree fruits is found along Lake Ontario, largely the result of favorable climatic conditions induced by the nearby lake. The climate over the Great Lakes Plain is also benevolent for a wide variety of vegetable crops. New York is a leading producer of grapes, with suitable weather conditions for viticulture existing in the western Great Lakes counties and on the sloping terrain along the Finger Lakes where good air drainage and moderating influence of lake waters produce a suitable temperature regime. The lower Hudson Valley has a climate, which also supports important acreage of tree fruits and truck crops.</p>\r\n<p>The warmer climate of eastern Long Island permits a significant production of potatoes for the early season market. Late-season potato varieties are grown in the cooler climate of the Southern Plateau and of northeastern New York. The uplands northwest of the Catskills Mountains have a cool climate very suitable for cauliflower production.</p>\r\n<p>The sugar maple tree (Acer saccharum Marsh) finds a climate optimum for growth in New York State. Thus, the production of syrup and other maple products constitutes a valuable segment of the agricultural and forestry economy.</p>\r\n<p>Ample precipitation, dependable runoff, and adequate groundwater supplies contribute to vast water resources in the Empire State. These water resources have supported the growth of many large metropolitan areas, the establishment of diverse industries and the development of waterways and impoundments for transportation, power, recreation and municipal supplies.</p>\r\n<p>Though rigorous and sometimes severe, New York's winter climate is an asset to the economy. Abundant snowfall has made skiing and snowmobiling important activities for winter sports and recreation. The climate at other times of the year is a prominent factor in attracting tourists and vacationers to the State.</p>\r\n<p>In summary, the climate contributes greatly to the agricultural, industrial, commercial and recreational economy. It has been an unquestionable asset to the historical development of New York State.</p>	40.49444	-79.76500	45.01167	-71.79028	1.248
35	North Carolina	NC	35.2139	-79.8909	6	<p>Topographic Features- North Carolina lies between 33.5 and 37&deg; North latitude and between 75 and 84.5&deg; West longitude. The extreme length from east to west is 503 miles: greater than any other state east of the Mississippi and its extreme breadth from north to south is 187 miles. The total area of the State is 52,712 square miles, of which 49,142 square miles are land and 3,570 squares miles are water.</p>\r\n<p>The range of altitude is also the greatest of any state east of the Mississippi River, ranging from sea level along the Atlantic coast to 6,684 feet at the summit of Mount Mitchell, the highest peak in the eastern United States. Mount Mitchell is in the heart of the Blue Ridge; this mountain range, along with the Great Smokies which lie partly in North Carolina and partly in Tennessee, form the highest part of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>\r\n<p>The three principal physiographic divisions of the eastern United States are particularly well developed in North Carolina. From east to west, they are the: Coastal Plain, Piedmont and Mountains.</p>\r\n<p>The land and water areas of the Coastal Plain comprise nearly half the area of the State. It may be divided roughly into two sections: the tidewater area, which is in large part flat and swampy, and the interior portion, which is gently sloping and, for the most part, naturally well drained. Throughout both sections of the Coastal Plain, the soils consist of soft sediment, with little or no underlying hard rock near the surface. The average slope is from about 200 feet at the "fall line", or western boundary, to generally less than 50 feet over the tidewater subdivision.</p>\r\n<p>The fall line is the dividing line between the Coastal Plain and the Piedmont. It may have at one time been the shoreline, since most of the soil to the east is sedimentary. Over the Piedmont, however, there is a great deal of hard rock near the surface. This area, comprising about one-third of the State, rises gently from about 200 feet at the fall line to near 1,500 feet at the base of the mountains. Although most of the Piedmont is gently rolling, there are several ranges of rather steep hills within its area, mainly in the Uwharrie Range around Randolph County and the Kings Mountain Range in Cleveland and Gaston counties.</p>\r\n<p>The westernmost, or Mountain Division of North Carolina is the smallest of the three, comprising a little more than one-fifth of the total area of the State. Its elevation range, however, is by far the greatest; it stretches upward from around 1,500 feet along the eastern boundary to 6,684 feet at the summit of Mount Mitchell. Some of the valleys drop to 1,000 feet above sea level while some 125 peaks exceed 5,000 feet and 43 tower above 6,000 feet. The surface of the Mountain Division is rocky; the soils are mainly weathered and eroded rocky materials.</p>\r\n<p>With its nearly 6,700-foot range in elevation and 300-mile range from the ocean, North Carolina has one of the most varied climates of any eastern state. Latitude accounts for some climatic variations, as do soils, plant cover and inland bodies of water. The Gulf Stream has some direct effect on North Carolina temperatures, especially on the immediate coast. Though the Gulf Stream lies some 50 miles offshore, warm water eddies spin off from it and moderate the winter air temperatures along the Outer Banks. Coastal fronts are common during the winter months, and can push inland, bringing warmer than expected temperatures to coastal areas. However, the southern reaches of the cold Labrador Current pass between the Gulf Stream and the North Carolina coast, offsetting most of the general warming effect the Gulf Stream might otherwise have on coastal temperatures. The meeting of the two opposing currents provides a breeding ground for rough weather. Strong low-pressure systems having their origin there develop into major storms, causing rain along the North Carolina coast and over states to the north as well.</p>\r\n<p>The rivers of North Carolina fall into two groups; those that flow into the Atlantic Ocean, and those that drain westward via the French Broad and the Tennessee rivers into the Mississippi River system.</p>\r\n<p>By far the greater portion of the State drains into the Atlantic Ocean. The principal rivers draining into the Atlantic are the: Roanoke, Tar, Neuse, Cape Fear, Yadkin and Catawba. The Roanoke River rises in the Allegheny Mountains west of Roanoke, Virginia, and flows in a southeasterly direction through Virginia and North Carolina for a distance of 400 miles, 150 miles of which is in North Carolina. The Tar, Neuse and Cape Fear rivers rise in the Piedmont Plateau in North Carolina and flow in a general southeasterly direction to the Atlantic Ocean. The Yadkin and Catawba rivers rise in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina and flow first easterly, then southeasterly into the Pee Dee and Santee rivers, respectively.</p>\r\n<p>The main stream draining the extreme western portion of the State is the French Broad River. This river rises in the mountains southwest of Asheville, flows first in a northerly direction then westward through the Great Smoky Mountains, into the Holston River just east of Knoxville, Tennessee. Intense rainstorms occur in this precipitous terrain and the streams rise quickly to flood stage.</p>\r\n<p>All North Carolina's rivers commonly have a maximum flow in late spring, with low flow in fall. It is rare for any but the very smallest streams to be dry at any time. However, all are likely to flood. Flash floods on small streams in the mountains, connected with heavy rains falling onto saturated or frozen soil, are most common in spring. Floods covering a wider area and extending into the Piedmont are most likely in winter, when traveling weather systems bring prolonged rain to a large portion of the state. The most severe floods, however, are those during autumn which are associated with tropical systems or their remnants. Rarely will a single hurricane cause major flood damage, but two in succession, or one coming after a very wet spell, can be very destructive, causing several river basins to flood at the same time. Although this is most likely to affect the coastal plain, such major floods have been recorded in all parts of the state, including the mountains. Dams have been constructed on most major rivers in North Carolina. Although some have been primarily for hydroelectric generation or water supply, they all serve as flood control structures. As a consequence, the frequency of severe flooding has decreased. Nevertheless, there are still situations where the climate of North Carolina will provide sufficient rain to ensure that floods continue to occur in the future.</p>\r\n<p>Temperature- The most important single influence contributing to the variability of North Carolina climate is altitude. In all seasons of the year, the average temperature varies more than 20 degrees Fahrenheit (&deg; F) from the lower coast to the highest elevations. The average annual temperature at Southport on the lower coast is nearly as high as that of interior northern Florida, while the average on the summit of Mount Mitchell is lower than that of Buffalo, New York.</p>\r\n<p>In winter, the greater part of North Carolina is partially protected by the mountain ranges from the frequent outbreaks of cold air which move southeastward across the central states. Such outbreaks often move southward all the way to the Gulf of Mexico without attaining sufficient strength and depth to traverse the heights of the Appalachian Range. When cold waves do break across, they are usually modified by the crossing and the descent on the eastern slopes. The temperature drops to 10 to 12&deg; F about once during an average winter over central North Carolina, ranging some 10 degrees warmer the coast and 10 degrees colder in the mountains. Temperatures as low as 0&deg; F are rare outside the mountains, but these temperatures have occurred throughout the western part of the State. The lowest temperature of record is -34&deg; F recorded January 21, 1985, at Mount Mitchell. Winter temperatures in the eastern sections are modified by the Atlantic Ocean which raises the average winter temperature and decreases the average day-to-night range.</p>\r\n<p>In spring, the storm systems that bring cold weather southward reach North Carolina less often and less forcefully, and temperatures begin to modify. The rise in average temperatures is greater in May than in any other month.</p>\r\n<p>Occasional invasions of cool, dry air from the north continue during the summer, but their effect on temperatures is slight and of short duration.</p>\r\n<p>The increase in sunshine which follows usually brings temperatures back up quickly. When the dryness of the air is sufficient to keep cloudiness at a minimum for several days, temperatures may occasionally reach 100&deg; F or higher in the interior at elevations below 1,500 feet. Ordinarily, however, summer cloudiness develops to limit the sun's heating while temperatures are still in the 90&deg; F range. Rarely, an entire summer passes without a high of 100 being recorded in the State. The average daily maximum reading in mid-summer is below 90&deg; F for most localities.</p>\r\n<p>Differences in temperatures over the various parts of the State are no less pronounced in summer than in winter. The warmest days are found in the interior rather than near the coast in summer. The average daily maximum temperature at mid-summer exceeds 92 at Goldsboro and Fayetteville, for example, while on the southernmost part of the coast it is 89&deg; F. The mid-July average afternoon high temperature atop Mount Mitchell is only 68, while over widely populated areas in the Mountain Division the figure is around 85&deg; F. Morning temperatures average about 20&deg; F degrees lower than those in the afternoon except along the immediate coast, where the daily range is only 10 to 15 degrees.</p>\r\n<p>Autumn is the season of most rapidly changing temperature, the daily downward trend being greater than the corresponding rise in spring. The drop-off is greatest during October, and continues at a rapid pace in November, so that average daily temperatures by the end of that month are within about five degrees of the lowest point of the year.</p>\r\n<p>Precipitation- While there are no distinct wet and dry seasons in North Carolina, average rainfall does vary around the year. Summer precipitation is normally the greatest, and July is the wettest month. Summer rainfall is also the most variable, occurring mostly in connection with showers and thunderstorms. Daily showers are not uncommon, nor are periods of one to two weeks without rain. Autumn is the driest season, and November the driest month. Precipitation during winter and spring occurs mostly in connection with migratory low pressure storms, which appear with greater regularity and in a more even distribution than summer showers. In southwestern North Carolina, where moist southerly winds are forced upward in passing over the mountain barrier, the annual average is more than 90 inches. This region is the rainiest in the eastern United States. Less than 50 miles to the north, in the valley of the French Broad River, sheltered by mountain ranges on all sides, is the driest point south of Virginia and east of the Mississippi River. Here the average annual precipitation is only 37 inches. East of the Mountains, average annual rainfall ranges mostly between 40 and 55 inches.</p>\r\n<p>Winter-type precipitation usually occurs with southerly through easterly winds, and is seldom associated with very cold weather. Snow and sleet occur on an average once or twice a year near the coast, and not much more often over the southeastern half of the State. Such occurrences are nearly always connected with northeasterly winds, generated when a high pressure system over the interior, or northeastern United States, causes a southward flow of cold dry air down the coastline, while offshore a low pressure system brings in warmer, moist air from the North Atlantic. Farther inland, over the mountains and western Piedmont, frozen precipitation sometimes occurs in connection with low pressure storms, and in the extreme west with cold front passages from the northwest. Average winter snowfall over the State ranges from about inch per year on the Outer Banks and along the lower coast to about 10 inches in the northern Piedmont and 16 inches in the southern Mountains. Some of the higher mountain peaks and upper slopes receive an average of nearly 50 inches a year.</p>\r\n<p>The average relative humidity does not vary greatly from season to season but is generally the highest in winter and lowest in spring. The lowest relative humidities are found over the southern Piedmont, where the year around average is about 65 percent. The highest are along the immediate coast, averaging around 75 percent. The least amount of actual moisture is found in the higher mountains. The lower temperatures, however, result in relative humidities that are about the same as elsewhere in the State.</p>\r\n<p>Sunshine is relatively abundant. The average annual percent of possible sunshine ranges between 58 to 65 percent. On average, 26 days per year are clear, 117 partly cloudy and 122 cloudy, while measurable rain falls on 120 days. The prevailing winds are generally from the southwest for 10 months of the year, and from the northeast during September and October. The average wind speed is about eight to 10 mph; however, winds along the coast can exceed 100 mph when hurricanes strike.</p>\r\n<p>In most years the greatest economic loss entailed in North Carolina from severe weather is probably due to summer thunderstorms. These storms usually affect only limited areas, but hail and wind occurring with some of them account for an average yearly loss of over $5 million. In any given locality, 40 or 50 thunderstorms may be expected in a year.</p>\r\n<p>North Carolina is outside the principal tornado area of the United States, but still averages 13 per year. They occur mostly east of the Mountains during early spring.</p>\r\n<p>Hurricanes come close enough to influence North Carolina weather about twice in an average year. Less frequently, these storms strike a part of the State with sufficient force to do much damage to inland property. Coastal properties occasionally suffer severe damage from associated high tides.</p>\r\n<p>Climate and the Economy- The variety of climate in North Carolina produces a wide range of vegetation. Along the southern coast the warm ocean currents stimulate vegetation often associated with Florida while north of Cape Hatteras the cooler ocean waters lead to vegetation often akin to that of New England. Similarly, the Great Smoky Mountains are a meeting ground for northern and southern forest species. The range of opportunities for agriculture reflect this climatic and vegetation diversity. The average annual freeze-free period ("growing season") lasts from about 130 days in the highest mountain areas to around 290 days on the Outer Banks. At Hatteras, entire seasons often pass without either frost or freezing temperature occurring and tropical fruits can be grown in sheltered spots.</p>\r\n<p>The traditional agricultural cash crops of North Carolina are tobacco and cotton. Soils and climate combine to provide optimum conditions for the former, with acreage scattered throughout the State. For cotton, the State is near the northern limit for cultivation, but the plant is grown across the Coastal Plain.</p>\r\n<p>The Coastal Plain is the major area for extensive agricultural crops, including soybeans, peanuts, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn for seed, wheat and several other small grains. This is the area with deep soils, abundant flat land and long growing seasons. In most years, precipitation is sufficient for crop growth, but much of the area is irrigated. This not only ensures optimum yields, but also allows some crops to obtain two harvests per year.</p>\r\n<p>North Carolina is a national leader in the production of hogs, turkeys and chickens. Many are reared in climate-controlled buildings, with the State's climate minimizing the need for winter heating, while fans are sufficient to provide summer cooling. Again, the eastern part of the State leads in production, although a considerable number of chickens are raised on the Piedmont.</p>\r\n<p>The Piedmont is the center of population for the State, and is the major area for hay and cattle production. This is also an area where agricultural products destined for the local urban centers, ranging from turf for lawns to grapes for wine, are produced. The sandy soils of the Sandhills region warm rapidly in spring and allow the production of early peaches, destined for not only the local market but also for shipment to areas further north.</p>\r\n<p>Although agricultural production is much smaller in the mountain region, given the rugged topography and cooler climate, there have always been areas of specialized agriculture. There has been a long tradition of apple production in the area known as the "Thermal Belts". In the 19th century, pioneer horticulturalists discovered that in the southern mountains of the State the growing season was longer on the hill slopes than on the mountain tops or in the valley bottoms. Apples thrived in the thermal belts. Eventually the name was applied to the whole area, which still is a major apple growing region in the mountains.</p>\r\n<p>More recently the northwestern part of the State has been able to utilize its cool climate and well-drained land to specialize in the production of Christmas trees. Other mountain areas produce high quality, high value crops, especially soft-fruits and out-of-season vegetables, by using black plastic mulches and drip irrigation to control the microclimate of crops growing in the fertile valley bottom soils.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout the State abundant moisture, fertile soils and high temperatures encourage tree growth. Forests, ranging in size from woodlots of less than an acre to the million acre national forests of the far west, cover over 50 percent of the State's land area. Pulp and paper production facilities are an important part of the economy in several locations scattered over the State.</p>\r\n<p>In most summers North Carolina's weather is dominated by the "Bermuda High" pressure system. This gives calm, virtually cloudless conditions where any pollution placed into the atmosphere remains suspended for an extended period of time. Compared to many other states, North Carolina does not support activities which emit great quantities of pollution. But automobile traffic in the major cities, along with some paper producing and energy generation plants can cause local problems for short periods of time. Additionally, with winds coming predominantly from a westerly direction, North Carolina also receives pollution from a suite of upwind states. On occasion this can severely reduce visibility in the western mountains, and has been regarded as a major contributor to the presence of acid rain on some of the highest peaks.</p>\r\n<p>North Carolina is a major tourist destination and a popular center for retirement. These activities are concentrated in three areas: mountains, beaches, and Sandhills. Climate plays a major role in all of them.</p>\r\n<p>The mountains, because of their mild summer temperatures, have always provided a welcome escape from the heat at lower elevations. Midsummer afternoon temperatures average less than 80&deg; F at elevations of 3,000 feet or higher; nights are crisp and cool, but seldom too cold for outdoor activities or light camping. At the same time, mountain streams and forests furnish plenty of space and opportunity for hiking, climbing, fishing or hunting, while there are many lakes with boating facilities and resorts with golf or similar opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>The summer mountain resorts are also winter ski resorts. Although some snowfall is likely most years, resorts use snowmaking equipment to ensure a reliable supply. Large snow amounts and severe low temperatures are rare in the mountains away from the highest peaks. January daytime averages in the valleys where people live are commonly around 45&deg; F, with overnight lows reaching down to 20. So the climate is not extreme, even compared to lower-altitude areas farther north, and fosters year round activity. Retirement communities have developed in response.</p>\r\n<p>Year-round vacation and retirement communities have also developed along the North Carolina beaches. Summer air temperatures along the immediate coastline are considerably lower than those even a few miles inland. Midsummer ocean water temperatures are around 80&deg; F along the entire coast, practically all of which is suitable for ocean recreation. Opposite the ocean, across the narrow barrier islands behind most beaches are the "Sounds". These protected inland waters, calm, quiet and sheltered even from the sea breezes, are bordered on both sides by cool forests and productive swamps with unique vegetation and wildlife. Fishing, ranging from deep sea to soundside to inland lake and stream, is one of the most popular of sports.</p>\r\n<p>This North Carolina beach country, especially the southern portion, is popular for year-round vacationing. Both air and water temperatures are generally mild; the average ocean water temperature at Southport in January is higher than along the northern coast of Maine in July.</p>\r\n<p>The third of North Carolina's resort and retirement areas is the "Sandhills" section of the southern Piedmont. Here, due to the sandy character of the soils, the average winter daytime temperature is higher and the relative humidity lower than in any other similarly exposed section of the State. Winter rains are readily absorbed by the sandy soils so conditions underfoot remain dry, while snow is a rarity. Horse racing, golf and other outdoor sports are widely enjoyed. Pinehurst and Southern Pines, in the center of this area, have become popular places for the retirement of those seeking a moderate climate.</p>	34.00000	-84.25000	36.35000	-75.50000	2.998

38	Oklahoma	OK	35.31	-98.17	6	<p>Topographic Features- Oklahoma is located in the southern Great Plains. Of the 50 states, it ranks 19th in size, with an area of 69,920 square miles, about 1,224 square miles are covered by water. Its northern boundary is about 465 miles in length while its southern boundary is 315 miles long. The greatest distance from north to south is 222 miles.</p>\r\n<p>The terrain is mostly plains, varying from nearly flat in the west to rolling in the central and near east, with a general slope upward from east to west. The plains are broken by scattered hilly areas where most points are 600 feet or less above the adjacent countryside. These hilly areas include the Wichita Mountains in the southwest, and the Arbuckle Mountains in the south-central. The Ouachita Mountains dominate much of the southeast, with peaks that rise as much as 2,000 feet above their base. Extreme east central Oklahoma features the mountains of the Arkansas River valley, which rise several hundred feet above the plains. Extreme northeastern counties are part of the Ozark Plateau, which is marked by steep, rocky, river valleys between large areas of hills and rolling plains. The western tip of the panhandle features part of the Black Mesa complex, a fractured terrain featuring large mesa overlooking seasonal creek and riverbeds. Elevations range from 287 feet above sea level where the Little River exits in southeastern Oklahoma to 4,973 feet on Black Mesa near the New Mexico border.</p>\r\n<p>Oklahoma lies entirely within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. The two main rivers in the State are the Arkansas, which drains the northern two-thirds of the State, and the Red, which drains the southern third and serves as the State's southern border. Principal tributaries of the Arkansas are the: Verdigris, Grand (Neosho), Illinois, Cimarron, Canadian and North Canadian. The Washita and Kiamichi serve as the Red's principal tributaries in Oklahoma, with the Little River flowing into the Red after it crosses into Arkansas.</p>\r\n<p>The climate of Oklahoma is continental, as is all of the Great Plains. Warm, moist air moving northward from the Gulf of Mexico often exerts much influence, particularly over the southern and eastern portions of the State, where humidity, cloudiness and precipitation are resultantly greater than in western and northern sections. Summers are long and usually quite hot. Winters are shorter and less rigorous than those of the more northern Plains states. Periods of extreme cold are infrequent, and those lasting more than a few days are rare.</p>\r\n<p>Temperature- The mean annual temperature over the State ranges from 62 degrees Fahrenheit (&deg; F) along the Red River to about 58 along the northern border. It then decreases westward to 56 in Cimarron County. Temperatures of 90&deg; F or greater occur, on average, about 60 to 65 days per year in the western panhandle and the northeast corner of the State. In the southwest, the average is about 115 days, and in the southeast about 85 days. Temperatures of 100&deg; F or higher occur, frequently during some years, from May through September, and very rarely in April and October. The western half of the State, excluding most of the panhandle, averages 15 or more days with triple-digit temperatures ranging from about 35 in the southwest corner and 25 in the northwest. The eastern half of the State and most of the panhandle average less than 15 such days. Years without 100&deg; F temperatures are rare, ranging from about one of every seven years in the eastern half of the State to somewhat rarer in the west.</p>\r\n<p>The highest temperature ever recorded in the State was 120&deg; F. This reading was first observed during the brutally hot summer of 1936: at Alva on July 18, at Altus on July 19 and August 12, and at Poteau on August 10. Tishomingo observed 120&deg; F on July 26, 1943. The Oklahoma Mesonet station near Tipton tied the mark on June 27, 1994.</p>\r\n<p>Temperatures of 32&deg; F or less occur, on average, about 60 days per year in the southeast. This value increases to about 110 days per year where the panhandle joins the rest of the State and further to 140 in the western panhandle. The lowest temperature on record is -27&deg; F, set originally at Vinita on February 13, 1905, and tied at Watts on January 18, 1930.</p>\r\n<p>The average length of the growing season, or freeze-free period, is at a maximum of about 225 to 230 days in the southern tier of counties and in the Arkansas River valley downstream of Tulsa. The value generally decreases to about 195 days in the eastern panhandle, then more rapidly to 175 in the western panhandle. The general northwest-to-southeast gradient is interrupted in the Ouachita Mountains, where growing seasons are three to four weeks shorter compared to surrounding areas.</p>\r\n<p>Along the Red River, the average date of the last freeze of spring ranges from about March 15 in the east to April 1 in the west. In northern Oklahoma, the last freeze of spring occurs, on average, from about April 8 near the Missouri border to April 15 in the eastern panhandle to the last week of April in the western panhandle. Freezing temperatures have occurred as late as April 20 along the southern border and in east-central Oklahoma to about May 15 in northwest Oklahoma to the last days of May in the western panhandle. The average date of the autumn's first freeze varies from about October 15 in the western panhandle, to about October 25 along the northern border and in northwestern Oklahoma, to about November 10 along the Red River and in the Arkansas River valley downstream of Tulsa. Autumn freezes have occurred as early as about September 15 in the western third of the State to about October 15 in the southeast corner. Again, the Ouachita Mountains tend to differ from surrounding terrain by about two weeks during either season.</p>\r\n<p>Frozen soil is not a major problem, nor much of a deterrent to seasonal activities. Its occurrence is rather infrequent, of very limited depth, and of brief duration. The average maximum depth that frost penetrates the soil ranges from less than three inches in the southeastern corner of the State to more than 10 inches in the northwestern reaches. Extreme frost penetration ranges from about 10 inches in the southeast to almost 30 inches in the western panhandle. Factors having an important bearing on frost penetration are severity and duration of temperature below freezing; condition, character and moisture content of soil; and amount and character of protective cover, including snow cover.</p>\r\n<p>Precipitation- The dominant feature of the spatial distribution of rainfall is a sharp decrease in rainfall from east to west. Although precipitation is quite variable on a year-to-year basis, average annual precipitation ranges from about 17 inches in the far western panhandle to about 56 inches in the far southeast. Only July and August see a substantial relaxation of this gradient.</p>\r\n<p>The greatest annual precipitation recorded at an official reporting station was 84.47 inches at Kiamichi Tower in the southeast in 1957. The least annual rainfall occurred during 1956, when Regnier, in the extreme northwestern panhandle, observed 6.53 inches.</p>\r\n<p>The climatological maximum for precipitation comes in late spring for almost all of the State east of the panhandle. On average, May brings more precipitation than any other month across 90 percent of Oklahoma. A significant secondary maximum of precipitation exists during early autumn for most of the State. This secondary peak typically occurs in September, and is more pronounced in the eastern third of the State. In the northeast, this secondary maximum can be nearly the same magnitude as the springtime maximum. In the southeast the secondary maximum tends to occur later in autumn, owing largely to the influence of tropical disturbances in the Gulf of Mexico. The panhandle and adjacent counties are the major exception to the pattern described above. As one moves westward in this area, the dual maximum tends to converge into one peak in June. In the western third of the panhandle, July is the rainiest month. Even during these peak months, rainfall normals are less for the panhandle than for eastern Oklahoma.</p>\r\n<p>The frequency of days with measurable precipitation follows the same gradient as the annual accumulation, increasing from 45 days per year in western Oklahoma to 115 near the Arkansas border. On the average, more precipitation falls during the nighttime hours, while greatest rainfall intensities occur during late afternoon.</p>\r\n<p>The character of precipitation also varies by season. Wintertime precipitation tends to be somewhat widespread, stratiform in nature, and tied almost exclusively to synoptic-scale systems. Rainfall is the dominant precipitation type in winter for all but the panhandle region of Oklahoma. Summertime precipitation is almost entirely convective in nature, produced by mesoscale complexes and "garden-variety" thunderstorms. During the transition seasons of spring and autumn, both convective and stratiform precipitation occurs. A significant portion of the State's precipitation during the transition seasons is associated with systems of severe thunderstorms.</p>\r\n<p>Excessive rainfall occurs at times. Amounts of ten inches or more in 24 hours, while rare, have been recorded. The greatest official rainfall in a 24-hour period is 15.68 inches at Enid on October 11, 1973. Amounts up to 20 inches in a day have also been reported from non-standard sources.</p>\r\n<p>The gradient of average annual snowfall is nearly opposite that of precipitation, in that it increases from less than two inches in the extreme southeast to nearly 30 inches in the western panhandle. The frequency of snow events also increases sharply along the same gradient. Sites in southeast Oklahoma have gone several years between events, while northwestern Oklahoma typically records several snow events each winter. Blowing snow and blizzard conditions can pose significant problems for travelers, but the effects of most snowstorms in the State are short-lived. Snowfall remaining on the ground more than a few days is an uncommon occurrence in northwestern Oklahoma, quite rare in central Oklahoma, and almost unheard of in the southeast. The greatest seasonal snowfall ever recorded in the State was 87.3 inches at Beaver during the winter of 1911 - 1912. Buffalo observed the greatest monthly total of 36.0 inches in February 1971, including a daily snowfall record of 23 inches on the 21st day of that month.</p>\r\n<p>Freezing rain is a distinct wintertime hazard in Oklahoma. The resulting ice cover can down power lines and limbs, causing millions of dollars in damages and widespread power outages. Icing events make travel very treacherous, especially on secondary roads, where the hazard can last several days. Significant icing events occur with nearly the same frequency as heavy snow events, especially in the southeastern half or so of the State. While ice accumulation is usually less than an inch, storms that deposit several inches can occur once or more per decade. The consecutive winters of 2000 - 2001 and 2001 - 2002 each featured a major ice storm that deposited more than three inches of ice in 24 hours across much of southeast and central Oklahoma.</p>\r\n<p>Floods of major rivers and tributaries may occur during any season, but they occur with greatest frequency during those spring and autumn months associated with greatest rainfall. Such floods cost many lives and much property damage in the first 50 years of statehood, but flood prevention programs have reduced the frequency and severity of such events. Autumn floods are often associated with widespread heavy rains north of a stalled cold front, or the interaction between a surface front and remnants of a tropical system. Springtime floods usually occur in the warm sector of a slow-moving cyclone.</p>\r\n<p>Flash flooding of creeks and minor streams remains a serious threat, especially in urban and suburban areas, where development and removal of vegetation have increased runoff.</p>\r\n<p>Drought is a recurring part of Oklahoma's climate cycle, as it is in all the Plains states. Almost all of Oklahoma's usable surface water comes from precipitation that falls within the State's borders. Therefore, drought in Oklahoma is tied almost entirely to local rainfall patterns (i.e., the influence of upstream events on drought is very small). Western Oklahoma tends to be slightly more susceptible to drought because precipitation there tends to be more variable (percentage-wise) and marginal for dryland farm applications.</p>\r\n<p>Drought episodes can last from a few months to several years. Those that last a few months can elevate wildfire danger and impact municipal water use. Seasonal droughts can occur at any time of the year, and those that resonate with crop production cycles can cause billions of dollars of damage to the farm economy. Multi-season and multi-year episodes can severely impact large reservoirs, streamflow and groundwater.</p>\r\n<p>Since modern climatological record-keeping began in the late nineteenth century, the State has seen five major multi-year and multi-regional drought events. These occurred in the late 1890s, from 1909 - 1918, 1930 - 1940, 1952 - 1958 and, to a lesser extent, 1962 - 1972. Each of these episodes contained at least one year of above-normal rainfall. The drought of the 1930s is associated with the "Dust Bowl of the Great Plains", when socio-economic conditions, agricultural practices and drought forced the largest emigration of Oklahomans in State history.</p>\r\n<p>The agricultural impact of drought is increasingly mitigated on a farm-by-farm and year-by-year basis through irrigation of crops, mostly with fossil water. This practice dominates much of the panhandle and some of the rest of western Oklahoma.  </p>\r\n<p>Annual average relative humidity ranges from about 60 percent in the panhandle to just over 70 percent in the east and southeast. The average statewide dew point temperature ranges from 27 in January to 68&deg; F in July.</p>\r\n<p>Average annual lake evaporation varies from 48 inches in the extreme east to 65 inches in the southwest, numbers that far exceed the average yearly rainfall in those areas. Evaporation and percolation preclude use of about 80 percent of Oklahoma's precipitation.</p>\r\n<p>Prevailing winds are southerly to southeasterly throughout most of the State during the spring through autumn months. These prevailing winds veer to south-to-southwest in far western Oklahoma, including the panhandle. The winter wind regime is bimodal, with roughly equal split between northerly and southerly winds. In a diurnal sense, prevailing winds tend to oscillate from southeast to southwest to southeast from sunrise to sunset to sunrise. In the panhandle the daytime swing is more dramatic, with westerly winds prevailing. March and April are the windiest months, while July August and September are the calmest.</p>\r\n<p>Thunderstorms occur, on average, about 55 days per year in the east, decreasing to about 45 days per year in the southwest. The general gradient relaxes in northwestern Oklahoma, where annual thunderstorm days number about 50. The annual rate increases to near 60 in the extreme western panhandle. Late spring and early summer are the peak seasons for thunder, averaging about eight thunderstorms per month per location during these seasons. For the southeastern two-thirds of the State, thunder occurs most often in May. June is the peak month for much of the remainder of the State, while the western panhandle observes the most thunder in July. December and January, on average, feature the fewest thunderstorms, at a rate of less than one per month per location.</p>\r\n<p>Frequent frontal invasions and dry line development combined with favorable upper-level support make springtime the preferred season for violent thunderstorms, although they can occur at any time of year. Severe weather threats during spring are squall lines, mesoscale convective systems and rotating supercells that can produce very large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes. Autumn marks a secondary severe weather season, but the relative frequency of supercellular activity is much lower than during spring. General thunderstorms are quite common in the summer, but tend to be less organized storms of relatively short duration. These storms can produce locally heavy rain and some hail. Severe weather events during summer are predominantly mesoscale convective systems. These events tend to be nocturnal in nature.</p>\r\n<p>Severe weather can occur at any time of day, but the maximum frequency for severe weather is from mid-afternoon to sunset. This maximum shifts from afternoon hours in western Oklahoma to late afternoon and early evening in eastern Oklahoma because severe weather is often associated with surface boundaries that move west-to-east during the afternoon. Diurnally, precipitation shows a maximum during the overnight hours. This can be attributed somewhat to the nocturnal nature of heavy rain associated with summertime events, and heavy rains associated with the continuance of squall lines into eastern Oklahoma.</p>\r\n<p>Tornadoes are a particular hazard, in that the frequency of occurrence per unit area is among the greatest in the world. Since 1950, there's been on average 52 tornadoes observed annually within the State's borders. Tornadoes can occur at any time of year, but are easily most frequent during springtime. April, May and June represent the months of peak occurrence; these three months account for about three-fourths of the observations. May's average of 20 tornado observations per month is the greatest. The winter months each average less than one tornado per month. About 80 percent of tornadoes are observed between noon and midnight Central Standard Time, with the peak hours being between 4:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. Most, but not all, of Oklahoma's tornadoes travel to the north and east.</p>\r\n<p>On April 9, 1947, a large tornado killed 101 people in northwestern Oklahoma, almost all of these in Woodward. On May 3, 1999 an outbreak of tornadoes occurred across central Oklahoma. In 21 hours, 75 tornadoes were observed, causing 40 deaths and 700 injuries. The largest of these struck southwestern and southern portions of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area, destroying nearly 1,000 homes and inflicting over $1 billion in damages. Radar observations indicated winds of 318 mph, the greatest such observation to date. The difference in fatalities between these two events is attributable to improved recognition and warning capabilities and an enhanced awareness among the citizenry of the dangers of tornadoes.</p>\r\n<p>On the average, cloudiness increases from west to east in Oklahoma. The annual fraction of possible sunshine observed ranges from about 45 percent in eastern Oklahoma to near 65 percent in the panhandle. These fractions are highest in the summer and lowest in the winter for all portions of the State.</p>\r\n<p>Climate and the Economy- Agriculture, commerce, natural resource development, government and transportation are all important sectors of Oklahoma's economy. The livestock industry is of great importance to all sections of the State. Beef cattle represent the largest sector of the livestock industry, followed by swine, poultry, dairy production and horses. Leading crops, and their main areas of production are: wheat, western half of the State; hay, all sections; peanuts, south; cotton, southern half; corn, eastern half; feed grains, western half, especially in the panhandle where a tremendous agricultural economy, based on irrigation from groundwater, has been developed. Major natural resources developed in the State are petroleum, natural gas and timber, which is the dominant industry in the far southeast. Recovery of industrial minerals such as gypsum, sand, gravel, helium and iodine are significant to the State's economy.</p>\r\n<p>The climate of Oklahoma is favorable for a wide variety of recreational activities. With more man-made lakes than any other state, Oklahoma is attractive to vacationers who enjoy boating, water-skiing, fishing, hiking and camping.</p>	33.58333	-103.00000	37.00000	-94.48333	1.990
39	Oregon	OR	44.14	-120.5	6	<p>Topographic Features- Oregon enjoys a mild, though varied climate with only a rare occurrence of devastating weather elements such as cloudbursts, tornadoes or hailstorms severe enough to cause serious widespread damage. The single most important geographic feature of the climate of Oregon is the Pacific Ocean whose coastline makes up the western border. Because of the normal movement of air masses from west to east, most of the systems moving across Oregon have been modified extensively in traveling over the Pacific. As a result, winter minimum and summer maximum temperatures in the west, and to a lesser extent in the eastern portion, are greatly moderated. The occurrence of extreme low or high temperatures is generally associated with the occasional invasion of continental air masses. The unlimited supply of moisture available to air masses that move across the Pacific is largely responsible for the abundant rainfall over western Oregon and the higher elevations of the eastern portion.</p>\r\n<p>Beginning near and following the coast the full length of the State, the Coast Range is the farthest west of the three mountain ranges that exert an important influence on Oregon's climate. This range rises to between 2,000 and 3,000 feet above sea level in the northern part of the State and between 3,000 and 4,000 feet in the southern portion with occasional peaks rising another 1,000 to 1,500 feet. This range, athwart the path of the moisture-laden marine air moving in from the Pacific, forces it to rise as it moves eastward. The resultant cooling and condensation produces some of the heaviest annual rainfalls in the United States along the higher western slopes, and materially reduces the available moisture in the air.</p>\r\n<p>The Cascade Mountains parallel the Coast Range about 75 miles to the east and to within 50 to 75 miles of the California border where the two ranges merge, forming a fairly broad, rugged mountain chain known as the Rogue River Mountains. The Cascades rise from the broad valley of the Willamette eastward to an average height of about 5,000 feet, with a few peaks over 10,000 feet. One of these, Mount Hood, at an elevation of 11,239 feet, is the highest point in the State. Once again, the air masses from the west are forced to ascend causing them to give up additional moisture. The rain potential of the marine air, however, was greatly reduced by passage over the Coast Range; therefore, the rainfall on the west slopes of the Cascades at a corresponding elevation is only about one-half to two-thirds as great as on the Coast Range. Precipitation amounts decrease rapidly once the crest is crossed and descent down the eastward side begins.</p>\r\n<p>The Blue Mountains extend from the northeast corner southwestward to the valleys of the John Day and Deschutes rivers in central Oregon. Part of the chain projects southeast to the Snake River valley, while in the northeast a separate branch is known as the Wallowa Mountains. These mountains, roughly between 5,000 and 6,000 feet with peaks from 7,000 to 9,000 feet, also exert an influence on the climate in the immediate area including several sizable valleys, particularly those of the Umatilla and Grand Ronde rivers. However, the overall effect is much less than that of either the Coast or Cascade ranges. These mountains are the source of a number of small streams used for irrigation and power production. They are also in an area of fairly heavy snowfall which provides excellent skiing. The snowmelt maintains the steady and reliable water flow necessary for fine trout and salmon streams.</p>\r\n<p>The Steens Mountains are a short range in the southeast part of the State less than 25 miles in length and only a very local climatic significance. The main crest is slightly more than 8,000 feet above sea level, with one peak of 9,354 feet. They serve as a snow shed that feeds several small streams useful to local irrigation. Most important of these is the Donner und Blitzen River.</p>\r\n<p>The Columbia River is of vital economic importance to the State, since the large dams along its course generate most of the hydroelectric power in the Northwest. Its waters are used to irrigate thousands of acres of rich agricultural land in the Boardman and Portland areas. As a major waterway it carries millions of tons of shipping hundreds of miles inland each year. The ports of Vancouver on the Columbia, and Portland on the Willamette at its confluence with the Columbia, are among the finest and largest fresh water ports in the world. Cutting through both the Cascade and the Coast Ranges, the Columbia Gorge offers ready passage of marine air from the Pacific. Temperatures are moderated to the east in both summer and winter. Continental air occasionally passes in reverse and produces the more extreme low temperatures in the western valleys.</p>\r\n<p>Winding through the rugged terrain that makes up much of Oregon are the Columbia and Snake river basins, the valleys of the many streams that head in the mountains and several very wide plateau regions. The valleys, particularly those of the Columbia, Snake, Willamette, Rouge and Hood Rivers, produce most of Oregon's agricultural wealth; however, the mountain and plateau regions are used extensively for livestock grazing and dryland farming. The Columbia Plateau covers about two-thirds of the State's total area and extends from the eastern border westward to the eastern slopes of the Cascade Mountains and from the southern border north to the Columbia River. Its elevations ranges from 4,000 to 6,000 feet and because of its arid nature and scant vegetation, summer heating and winter cooling often become extreme.</p>\r\n<p>The State is divided into six major agroclimatic areas:</p>\r\n<p>1) Coastal and Lower Columbia (Clatsop, Columbia, Coos, Curry, Lincoln and Tillamook counties): This is a heavily timbered area with copious rainfall much of the year resulting in lush pastures, largely responsible for the predominance of dairying in these counties. Along the lower Columbia and in the northern Coastal valleys production of grass seed, flower bulbs, cranberries and milk add significantly to the farm income. In the southern coastal counties, in addition to dairy and meat production, substantial supplements to the farm income include wool, cranberries, legumes, seeds, nuts, fruit, strawberries, and a large lily bulb and cut flower industry.</p>\r\n<p>2) Willamette Valley (Benton, Clackamas, Lane, Linn, Marion, Multnomah, Polk, Washington and Yamhill counties): This is by far the most diversified agricultural area in the State. Its climate is relatively free of extremes in temperatures; growing seasons are long, and moisture is abundant most of the year, although summer irrigation is used. There are extensive commercial productions of hay, grain, truck crops, apples, pears, sweet cherries, hops, onions, potatoes, mint, flax, vegetables, specialty grass seeds and many other miscellaneous crops. Other farm operations include dairying, poultry raising and extensive nurseries.</p>\r\n<p>3) Southwestern Oregon (Douglas, Jackson and Josephine counties): This region is best known for the Rouge River pear industry. Fruit growing, dairying, the growing of hay, grain and seed crops, and raising beef cattle, poultry and sheep are economically important. The growing of bulbs and hops adds substantially to the agricultural economy.</p>\r\n<p>4) Columbia Basin (Gilliam, Hood River, Morrow, Sherman, Umatilla, Wasco and Wheeler counties): This is Oregon's major wheat producing area. Grain, raised on dryland farms and fruit farming are the main source of farm income in these counties. Fruits are also raised commercially in counties adjacent to the Columbia River. Truck crops raised under irrigation are important. Additionally, cattle, sheep, alfalfa and poultry make substantial contributions to the agricultural wealth of the region.</p>\r\n<p>5) South Central Oregon (Crook, Deschutes, Grant, Harney, Jefferson, Klamath and Lake counties): This region is primarily livestock country with vast spring, summer and fall ranges. In addition to beef cattle, which are the dominant livestock interest, there is also extensive raising of sheep, dairy herds, horses and swine. Field crops grown on commercial basis include potatoes, alfalfa, wheat, oats, barley and onions.</p>\r\n<p>6) Snake River Basin (Baker, Malheur, Union and Wallowa counties): Livestock raising is a major industry. While beef cattle predominate, sheep, dairy herds, hogs and poultry are all important contributors to the farm income. In most of these counties the principal crops are wheat, potatoes, barely, oats and grass seed. In addition to crops already mentioned, this county produced large acreages of sugar beets, onions, peas, tomatoes, berries, sweet corn and miscellaneous crops.</p>\r\n<p>Temperature- Few states have greater temperature extremes than Oregon where they have ranged from a low of -54 degrees Fahrenheit (&deg; F) to a high of 119&deg; F. Seldom, however, do daily extremes occur even closely approaching these absolute records. Specifically for Portland, January averages 40 while the July average is 68&deg; F. Temperatures of 90&deg; F or greater occur about 13 days annually. In the inland valleys of the southwest the average summer temperatures are about five degrees higher than in the northwest and maximums of 90&deg; F or higher occur 40 to 50 days a year. In south-central Oregon the median annual maximum temperatures are between 95 and 100; in most other areas east of the Cascades this variance is between 100 and 105&deg; F. Median annual minimum temperatures for eastern Oregon vary from near zero Fahrenheit in the more protected areas of the Columbia Basin to nearly -30&deg; F in the high mountain and plateau regions. The minima for majority of these stations, however, lie in -1 to -10&deg; F range. The normal mean January temperature in southeast Oregon is 25 to 28 while in the northeast it is 29 to 33&deg; F; July normal means range from 65 to 70 in the central valleys and plateau regions and 70 to 78&deg; F along the eastern border.</p>\r\n<p>Precipitation- The average annual rainfall in Oregon varies from as much as 200 inches at points long the upper west slopes of the Coast Range to less than eight inches in Plateau regions. Accordingly, vegetation ranges from the heavily wooded Coast Range and west slopes of the Cascades with their dense undergrowth to only a very sparse growth of sagebrush and desert type grasses over the wide plateau areas of central Oregon.</p>\r\n<p>The State as a whole has a very definite winter rainfall climate. West of the Cascades about one-half of the annual total precipitation falls from December through February; about one-fourth in the spring and fall and very little during the summer months. East of the Cascades the differences are not as pronounced with slightly more precipitation in winter than in spring and fall, while only about 10 percent falls during the summer. Along the coast the normal annual total is from 75 to 90 inches, and increases up the west slopes of the Coast Range to almost 200 inches near the crest. Amounts decrease on the eastern slopes and in the Willamette Valley. On the western slopes of the Cascades there is again a marked increase in precipitation with elevation as annual averages range up to 75 inches. Amounts decrease rapidly on the east side. The annual average precipitation for the great plateau of the State is often less than eight inches. In the Columbia River Basin and the Blue Mountains, totals are about 15 to 20 inches; however, some of the mountain regions receive as much as 35 inches.</p>\r\n<p>The State's heaviest snowfalls occur in the high Cascades. Annual average totals can range from 300 to 550 inches. An annual snowfall of approximately 900 inches (82.5 feet) and a snow depth of 252 inches (21 feet) have been recorded at Crater Lake National Park Headquarters. Winter precipitation along the Coast Range, due to its lower elevations, occurs largely in the form of rain, although it too is occasionally subject to very heavy snows. In the Blue Mountains, seasonal totals range between 150 to 300 inches and depths on the ground may occasionally exceed 120 inches. The periods of continuous snow cover vary with elevation. On the peaks of the Cascades higher than 7,000 feet above sea level it persists in glacial form the year around. In most mountain areas above 4,500 feet snow cover lasts from early December until the latter part of April. Above 4,500 feet, snow depths (again varying with elevation) are approximately 50 to 100 inches in the Cascades, 25 to 65 inches in the Blue Mountains at the end of January; 60 to 125 inches and 25 to 70 inches, respectively, at the end of February; 75 to 135 inches and 25 to 80 inches at the end of March; 40 to 120 inches and five to 45 inches at the end of April.</p>\r\n<p>Along the coast the average annual snowfall is only one to three inches, with many years in which there is no measurable amount. In the inland western valleys most yearly totals average between 10 to 15 inches, with snow on the ground seldom lasting more than two to three days at a time. In north-central Oregon the annual average is 15 to 30 inches, while over the higher plateau region that makes up the south-central portion snowfall ranges up to as much as 60 inches. In the valleys of the northeast 40 to 75 inches is normal, while in the Snake River Basin which makes up most of the southeast it is only 15 to 40 inches. Every few years some part of the State will receive 20 to 25 inches of snow in a 24-hour period.</p>\r\n<p>Hailstorms occur each year, but are generally light and cover very small areas. They cause damage annually to crops, vehicles and buildings. Practically all of these storms occur east of the Cascades. In the western part of the State, thunderstorms occur in the valleys an average of four to five days a year and are not usually severe. In the eastern part, they occur on 12 to 15 days with heavier precipitation and greater wind damage; however, total losses are not extensive.</p>\r\n<p>It is in the mountain areas that these storms occur most frequently and each year many forest fires are started by lightning.</p>\r\n<p>Several times each year winds of hurricane force (74 mph and higher) strike the Oregon coast. They sometimes move inland to the western valleys and up the Columbia Gorge. Damage is usually confined to power and communication lines, to some crops, and to outdoor signs and timber. Very rarely does loss of life or major structural damage to buildings result. The annual average is one tornado. The prevailing wind direction is influenced by the surrounding terrain. In the Columbia Gorge for example, the prevailing direction of the wind follows the orientation of the gorge at that point. Similarly, in the Willamette Valley prevailing directions are aligned north-south with the valley. The very strong winds, of course, are determined by the directions of the major storm movements. The fastest winds are generally from the south or west. Light winds greatly outnumber the strong storm winds, and mountain slopes and other topographic features influence their direction.</p>\r\n<p>Most of the State is drained into the Pacific Ocean through the Columbia River. Major tributaries to the Columbia include the: Willamette draining both the east slope of the Coast Range and the west slope of the Cascades; Deschutes; John Day; Umatilla and Snake rivers. The Snake makes up more than half of Oregon's eastern border and drains practically all the State east of the Blue Mountains. The west slope of the Coast Range and all areas south of the Willamette Basin and west of the summit of the Cascades are drained directly into the Pacific Ocean by three large river systems - the: Umpqua, Rogue and Smith rivers along with a number of smaller coastal steams. The only major river draining south central Oregon is the Klamath. The remainder of the area lying south of the Deschutes and John Day basins and between the Cascades and the Blue Mountains has only internal drainage into brackish lakes. Many of these lakes become dry during the summer months.</p>\r\n<p>Major flooding in the Willamette Basin and the coastal steams usually results from several days of moderate to heavy rain extending over the entire Basin. When combined with sharply rising air temperatures and a warm southerly wind, the melting of a heavy snow pack on the middle and upper slopes of the Coast Range and/or the Cascades greatly increases the flood potential.</p>\r\n<p>Flooding in the main channel of the Columbia River usually occurs during late spring and early summer when snowmelt in the mountains is most rapid. Simultaneous occurrences of heavy, warm rain over large parts of the Columbia Basin, on occasion, produced some very damaging floods. The Columbia and Willamette rivers have many large multiple-purpose dams as an aid in flood control.</p>\r\n<p>During the early morning hours the relative humidity is greatest and there is little variation at this time between winter and summer readings in eastern and western Oregon. The 4:30 a.m. average for practically every station in the State from which relative humidity figures are available is between 82 and 92 percent in January and only about five percent less in each case in July. In contrast, the 4:40 p.m. averages, when the relative humidities are least, show a very marked difference between summer and winter and also between the areas east and west of the Cascades. The afternoon average relative humidity ranges between 75 and 85 percent in January, while in July this drops to 25 or 30 percent east of the Cascades and slightly higher on the western side. Relative humidities of 10 to 20 percent often occur under extreme conditions during the summer and early fall.</p>\r\n<p>The average dates of the last 32&deg; F temperature in the spring and the first in fall are used to determine the average length of the growing season. A temperature that is very critical to one type of vegetation may not be damaging to others. The length of the growing season is extremely variable and depends primarily on elevation and latitude. This period ranges from less than 50 to almost 300 days.</p>\r\n<p>From May through September 80 to 90 percent of annual evaporation takes place with a range from 18 to 46 inches.</p>\r\n<p>The north coastal area has the least sunshine, while the southeast corner of the state the most. During January, the sun will shine about 20 percent of the time possible in the coastal area and 45 percent of the time possible in the southeast. These values increase in April to values of 50 to 70 percent; in July to 55 percent the northwest and 90 percent in the southeast; and by October have declined to 40 and 65 percent, respectively.</p>\r\n<p>Climate and the Economy- Oregon's economy is very closely tied to its climate, with regard to its industry, agriculture and recreation. The mild temperatures and abundant rainfall on the middle and upper slopes of the Coast Range and the Cascade Mountains make this one of the fastest tree growing areas in the nation. Numerous board feet of Douglas fir and pine are harvested each year. Lumbering and the manufacture of related forest products are important industries for the State. The heavy sustained runoff from the high elevations makes it possible to generate vast quantities of hydroelectric power.</p>\r\n<p>Agriculture in Oregon is as varied as the climate that sustains it. Although annual precipitation ranges from less than 10 inches to more than 60 inches, the principal crop areas have one thing in common - their very predominate winter rainfall climate. There are years when the combined July and August total over the entire State averages only a quarter of an inch or less and the normal in the eastern part of the State for these two months is less than an inch. Despite this, a very wide range of crops are grown here. Because of the frequency of dry summers, agricultural crops and practices are planned accordingly.</p>\r\n<p>The most damaging drought condition is a very marked deficiency of rainfall during spring and early summer. It is needed then to complete maturity of hay and grain, and to bring on range forage. Seldom has the lack of moisture been severe enough to cause a complete crop failure over any sizable area. It does occasionally reduce crop yields and quality and force ranchers to put livestock on the market before the stock has reached prime conditions.</p>\r\n<p>The heavy winter precipitation in the mountain areas also provides an abundant water supply for irrigation. The dams that generate hydroelectric power, and others as well, are used to store winter rainfall for summer irrigation. Several private irrigation districts formed and an extensive system of canals built to bring water from reservoirs and streams to previously semi-desert land. In many areas, deep wells have been dug.</p>	42.00000	-124.50000	46.25000	-116.75000	1.260

44	South Dakota	SD	44.5	-100.5	6	<p>Topographic Features- Rolling plains are the main feature of South Dakota, varying from nearly level land to hilly ridges. Elevations increase from about 1,500 feet in the east to about 3,000 feet in the west, except in the Black Hills area. The Black Hills, an isolated group of forest-covered mountains, have a climate of their own.</p>\r\n<p>The soil covering the State was laid down in past ages by glaciers, water and wind. There are occasional outcroppings of bedrock. The Missouri River and its tributaries drain all of South Dakota except for a small portion of the northeastern part of the State. Some of this small drainage area is in the headwaters of the Red River of the North in the Hudson Bay Drainage, and the remainder is in the headwater area of the Minnesota River which forms a part of the upper Mississippi River Basin.</p>\r\n<p>South Dakota is bisected by the Missouri River which flows in a southerly direction to Pierre and then turns to the south-southeast where it forms the South Dakota-Nebraska state line. To the west of the Missouri lies a country of canyons, broad, upland flats and buttes. The principal tributaries which drain this region are the: Grand, Moreau and Cheyenne, which drain the Black Hills, and the White. To the east of the Missouri there are numerous small ponds and lakes, some of which dry up in periods of drought. The principal rivers of this area are the: James and Big Sioux. The larger of the two, the James River, has an extremely low slope and consequently is sluggish and meandering. Water falling on much of the eastern area does not reach the stream valleys at all, but lies in depressions until it evaporates or soaks into the ground.</p>\r\n<p>Temperature- Since South Dakota is situated in the heart of the North American Continent, it is near the paths of many cyclones and anticyclones, and has the extreme of summer heat and winter cold that are characteristic of continental climates. The highest temperature of record in the State is 120 degrees Fahrenheit (&deg; F) observed July 5, 1936, at Gannvalley; the lowest, -58&deg; F, February 17, 1936, at McIntosh. Rapid fluctuations in temperature are common. Partly because of the great distance from any large body of water, the ranges of daily, monthly and annual temperatures are very large. Temperatures of 100&deg; F or higher, are experienced in some part of the State each year, and on rare occasions such readings have been noted as early as April and as late as October. These high temperatures are usually attended by low humidity, which greatly reduces the oppressiveness of the heat. Subzero temperatures occur frequently on mid-winter mornings, but it is not often that the temperature stays subzero during the entire day. In the north, subzero temperatures can occur between October and April.</p>\r\n<p>Warm, âChinookâ winds and frequent sunny skies make the Black Hills area the warmest part of the State in the winter. Also, because of the tendency for very cold air to stay at low elevations, some of the arctic air outbreaks that blanket the eastern counties do not reach the higher counties in the west. During the summer, the higher elevation of the Black Hills results in that section having cooler temperatures than the rest of the State. At this season, the central and southeastern counties are warmest. The freeze-free season is shortest high in the Black Hills where brief freezing has been known to occur at any time of the summer. Elsewhere, the first autumn freeze generally occurs in mid-September in the northwest, in late September in the in the central and east, and the first week in October in the southeast corner. The average last freeze in the spring ranges from early May in the southeast to late May in the northwest.</p>\r\n<p>Precipitation- The annual precipitation decreases northwestward from about 25 inches in the southeast to less than 13 inches in the northwest. The Black Hills are again an exception, varying from 16 inches in their southern portion to almost 25 inches in the northern areas, where rain and snow are often formed when prevailing winds are abruptly forced up the mountainsides. Most of the State's precipitation occurs during the crop season, April through September. On the average, it reaches a maximum during June, and decreases sharply in early July. In the east, there is a small secondary increase in August, followed by an overall diminishing during autumn. The least precipitation is received during winter.</p>\r\n<p>Occasionally there is heavy snowfall in winter and the amount of snow on the ground accumulates to a considerable depth, but as a rule, the snow cover is not great. Wind usually accompanies the snow, causing a large proportion of it to collect in gullies and behind windbreaks. In the worst storms, isolated drifts many feet deep may block roads, while wind-swept fields nearby are nearly bare of snow. Accurate measurements of the snow are difficult since irregularities are introduced by the presence of buildings, fences, trees and weeds; and by variations in the terrain, wind and the snow itself. Snow that falls early in the season seldom stays on the ground very long. After the ground has frozen deeply and the daylight becomes short, it remains longer. Once snow cover is present, there is a tendency for it to continue, since the temperature falls to much lower levels over snow than over bare ground. Snowfall reaches a maximum in February and early March, and decreases markedly. Blizzards are not very frequent, but are a hazard those who are unprepared for a winter storm.</p>\r\n<p>Rainstorms occur most frequently in early summer, hailstorms are most frequent in midsummer, and lightning does its worst damage in late summer. In dry seasons, and particularly in the west in late summer, thunderstorm bases may be as high as two miles above the ground; consequently, the rain may evaporate before reaching the ground. Tornadoes are not uncommon in South Dakota, with an average of 23 reported in a year.</p>\r\n<p>The most serious flooding has been caused by rapid melting of snow pack and aggravated by ice jams. Heavy rainfall alone causes severe floods on tributary streams, especially in the eastern part of the State. Intense local storms result in flash flooding along minor tributaries. The flow of the Missouri River through the State is controlled by Fort Randall and Garrison dams which were constructed for purposes of flood control.</p>\r\n<p>A flood in the Rapid City area during the night of June 9 and the early morning of June 10, 1972 was spawned when six inches or more of rain fell over a six-hour period causing Canyon Lake Dam to fail. There were 236 deaths and over $150 million (1972 figure) in damage.</p>\r\n<p>Droughts are also fairly common due to the semi-arid environment.</p>\r\n<p>Climate and the Economy- The eastern half of the State has a limy soil, but it is arable, fertile and suitable for growing crops. The western half, because of limited moisture and more rugged terrain, is best suited for stock grazing, although other forms of agriculture are profitable in years of ample moisture. Irrigation is practiced to some extent. Extensive reservoirs have been created along the Missouri River, partly to provide water supplies for irrigation.</p>\r\n<p>There are few, if any, states more dependent upon agriculture than South Dakota. Since grasses flourish in the climate, it is not surprising that livestock and their products account for the greater part of the farm income. Cattle and hogs are the principal livestock, while wheat, corn and oats are the main crops. Hunting is a major recreational activity. Pheasant thrive in the east; antelope, deer and elk, are found in the west. Buffalo are maintained in preserves.</p>	42.49167	-104.05000	45.93333	-98.47583	1.126
